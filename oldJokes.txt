A vampire bat came flapping in from the night covered in fresh blood and parked himself on the roof of the cave to get some sleep. Pretty soon all the other bats smelled the blood and began hassling him about where he got it. He told them to go away and let him get some sleep but they persisted until finally he gave in."OK, follow me" he said and flew out of the cave with hundreds of bats behind him. Down through the valley they went, across a river and into a forest full of trees. Finally he slowed down and all the other bats excitedly milled around him. "Now, do you see that tree over there?" he asked. "Yes, Yes, Yes!" the bats all screamed in a frenzy. "Good" said the bat, "Because I sure as hell didn't!"

Everybody I know who has a dog usually calls him "Rover" or "Spot". I call mine Sex. Now, Sex has been very embarrassing to me. When I went to the City Hall to renew the dog's license, I told the clerk that I would like a license for Sex. He said, "I would like to have one too!" Then I said, "But she is a dog!" He said he didn't care what she looked like. I said, "You don't understand. .

.. I have had Sex since I was nine years old." He replied, "You must have been quite a strong boy." When I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have Sex at the wedding.

He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, "But Sex has played a big part in my life and my whole world revolves around Sex." He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family was barred from the church from then on. When my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, "You don't understand. .

.. Sex keeps me awake at night." The clerk said, "Me too!" One day I entered Sex in a contest. But before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have Sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. "You don't understand," I said, "I hoped to have Sex on TV." He called me a show off. When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, "Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married but Sex left me after I was married." The Judge said, "Me too!" Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her. A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning. I said, "I'm looking for Sex." -- My case comes up next Thursday. Well now I've been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw.

Why just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist, she asked me, "What seems to be the trouble?" I replied, "Sex has been my best friend all my life but now it has left me for ever. I couldn't live any longer so lonely." and the doctor said, "Look mister, you should understand that sex isn't a man's best friend so get yourself a dog."

"I'm sorry sir.", said the ticket agent, "We don't allow animals in the theater."The old farmer went around the corner and stuffed the bird down his pants. He returned to the booth, bought a ticket and entered the theater. He sat down next to two old widows named Mildred and Marge.

The movie started and the rooster began to squirm. The old farmer unzipped his pants so Chucky could stick his head out and watch the movie."Marge", whispered Mildred."What", said Marge."I think this guy next to me is a pervert.", said Mildred."What makes you think that", asked Marge."He unzipped his pants and he has his thing out", whispered Mildred."Well, don't worry about it", said Marge, "At our age we've seen them all."

A man was driving down a country road one day at 45 miles per hour when suddenly he noticed a 3-legged chicken running at the same speed beside his truck.

Though he thought this odd, the man decided to speed up so he wouldn't cause an accident with the chicken.

The man sped up to 55 miles per hour, but low and behold, so did the 3-legged chicken. The man then sped up to 65 miles per hour only to again be equaled in speed by the 3-legged chicken. As the man watched in amazement, the chicken suddenly made a sharp left turn and took off down a side road toward a small farm. The man quickly also made the left turn and followed the chicken to the small farm, parking out front. Looking around the man found the farmer around back in the midst of many 3-legged chickens.

After greeting the farmer, the man asked him why he was raising 3-legged chickens. "Well we figure," said the farmer, "that with an average family of 3 people, only 2 can have a chicken leg with an average chicken. But with a three legged chicken, each member of the family can enjoy a chicken leg of their own." "That's pretty wise," said the man, who then asked "Well how do your 3-legged chickens taste?"

"I don't know," said the farmer. "We've never been able to catch one."
####
Q:Why didn't the chicken cross the road?

A: because he was a "chicken".

Once upon a time in a nice little forest, there lived an orphaned bunny and an orphaned snake. By a surprising coincidence, both were blind from birth.

One day, the bunny was hopping through the forest, and the snake was slithering through the forest, when the bunny tripped over the snake and fell down. This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit."Oh, my," said the bunny, "I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I've been blind since birth, so I can't see where I'm going. In fact, since I'm also an orphan, I don't even know what I am."

"It's quite OK," replied the snake. "Actually, my story is much the same as yours. I, too, have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and find out what you are, so at least you'll have that going for you."

"Oh, that would be wonderful" replied the bunny. So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said, "Well, you're covered with soft fur, you have really long ears, your nose twitches, and you have a soft cottony tail. I'd say that you must be a bunny rabbit."

"Oh, thank you! Thank you," cried the bunny, in obvious excitement. The bunny suggested to the snake, "Maybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you've helped me."So the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, "Well, you're smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone, and no balls. I'd say you must be French".

Toilet TrickHey, this party was on April Fool's Day, so anything goes, right? Anyway, at the party there were two bathrooms. I went to the busiest one and did my usual medicine cabinet snooping and found some Icee Hot behind the mirror. So, on my way out I smeared the toilet seat with a thin layer of gel.

After I left, I got a beer but positioned myself so I could see if the next person out reacted. Yeah, baby!

The heat hit this chick as she was just leaving. Her eyes popped open and she did a 180 degree turn right back into the bathroom.

Good practical joke: priceless.

The Five Stages Of DrunkenessStage 1 - CLEVERThis is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known universe. You know you know everything and you want to pass on your knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always right. And, of course, the person you are talking to is very wrong. This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are CLEVER.

Stage 2 - ATTRACTIVEThis is when you realize that you are the most ATTRACTIVE person in the entire bar and that everyone fancies you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing that they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still CLEVER, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun.

Stage 3 - RICHThis is when you suddenly become the RICHEST person in the room. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have a bottomless wallet. You can also make bets at this stage because of course you are still CLEVER so, naturally, you will always win. Anyway, it doesn't matter how much you bet because you are RICH. You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, in the knowledge that you are clearly the most ATTRACTIVE person present.

Stage 4 - INVINCIBLEYou are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone, especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because you are now INVINCIBLE. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge them to a battle of wits or strength. You have no fear of losing this battle, because as well as being INVINCIBLE you are CLEVER, you're RICH and you're more ATTRACTIVE than them anyway.

Stage 5 - INVISIBLEThis is the final stage of drunkenness. At this point you can do anything, because you are now INVISIBLE. You can dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You can also snob the face off them for the same reason. You are also INVISIBLE to the people who want to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still CLEVER you know all the words.

THE FIVE STAGES OF SOBERING UPStage 1 - STUPIDAs you regain consciousness and begin to enjoy the headache, the churning stomach and the cold sweats, you realize that you have lost not only several hours of your life, but also the ability to concentrate on anything at all. You are now STUPID and will remain so for a minimum of 12 hours.

Stage 2 - UGLYNever entirely happy with the effects of the bathroom mirror, the first thing you are horrified to discover is that you have now become even UGLIER than you previously thought possible. Not only have you got bloodshot eyes and a glorious collection of spots but you are shaking so much that your grandfather probably looks healthier. Unfortunately you are still too STUPID to know better than to try to shave while still shaking.

Stage 3 - POORHaving crawled out of bed and got dressed, you are about to shamble out the door when you discover that the money that was to last you the week is now missing from your wallet. Being STUPID, you have no idea what happened to it but the traces of pizza on your clothes allow the possibility that you might have treated everyone to a takeout at some point. Alternatively your pocket could have been picked or you might have given the taxi driver a fifty dollar note by mistake. Rationionalizing that you couldn't possibly have been that STUPID and that you would remember being robbed, you come to believe that you were the only one who bought any food or drinks all night and start to loathe all your friends.

Stage 4 - FRAGILEAs you are now STUPID, UGLY and POOR, your consequently FRAGILE self-esteem plummets. Your already FRAGILE physical condition ensures that you feel liable to shatter if anyone even speaks to you.

Stage 5 - CONSPICUOUSThis is the final stage of sobering up. Unfortunately, everyone can spot this CONSPICUOUS condition and its cause from a great distance. Even worse, they know that they can complete your misery by making fun of you, and that you are too STUPID to retaliate, too FRAGILE to hit them, too POOR to bribe them and too UGLY to hide.

The bartender yells, "What's all the screaming about in there? You're scaring my customers!"

There was a guy in a bar one night that got really drunk. I mean really, really, really drunk. When the bar closed he got up to go home. As he stumbled out the door he saw a nun walking on the sidewalk. So he stumbled over to the nun and punched her in the face. Well the nun was really surprised but before she could do or say anything he punched her again. This time she fell down and he stumbled over to her and kicked her in the butt.

Then he picked her up and threw her into a wall. By this time the nun was pretty weak and couldn't move.

So then he stumbled over to her, put his face right next to hers and said. "Not very strong tonight, are you Batman?"
####
A fellow decides to take off early from work and go drinking. He stays until the bar closes at 2am, at which time he is extremely drunk. When he enters his house, he doesn't want to wake anyone, so he takes off his shoes and starts tip-toeing up the stairs.

Half-way up the stairs, he falls over backwards and lands flat on his rear end. That wouldn't have been so bad, except that he had couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke, and the broken glass carved up his buttocks terribly. But,

he was so drunk that he didn't know he was hurt. A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he noticed blood,

so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up something terrible. Well, he repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed.

The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting, and he was hunkering under the covers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom."Well, you really tied one on last night," she said."Where'd you go?" "I worked late," he said, "and I stopped off for a couple of beers."

"A couple of beers? That's a laugh," she replied, "You got plastered last night. Where the heck did you go?"

"What makes you so sure I got drunk last night,

anyway?"

"Well," she replied, "my first big clue was when I got up this morning and found a bunch of band-aids stuck to the mirror."

A guy walks into a bar and sits down. He starts dialing numbers like there's a telephone in his hand, then puts his palm up against his cheek and begins talking. Suspicious, the bartender walks over and tells him this is a very tough neighborhood and he doesn't need any trouble here. The guy says, "You don't understand. I'm very hi-tech. I had a phone installed in my hand because I was tired of carrying the cellular." The bartender says "Prove it." The guy dials up a number and hands his hand to the bartender. The bartender talks into the hand and carries on a conversation. "That's incredible!" says the bartender. "I would never have believed it!" "Yeah", said the guy, "I can keep in touch with my broker, my wife, you name it. By the way, where is the men's room?" The bartender directs him to the men's room. The guy goes in and 5, 10, 20 minutes go by and he doesn't return. Fearing the worst given the neighborhood, the bartender goes into the men's room to check on the guy. The guy is spread-eagled up against the wall. His pants are pulled down and he has a roll of toilet paper up his butt. "Oh my god!" said the bartender. "Did they rob you? Are you hurt?" The guy turns and says: "No, no, I'm ok. I'm just waiting for a fax."

A drunk walked into a tavern, sat down at the bar. He placed a small cardboard box on the bar, and ordered a beer. When the beer came, he opened the box, pulled out a tiny piano and bench and set them on the bar, then ordered another beer. When the beer came, he reached into the box, pulled out a frog, sat him on the piano bench and said, "PLAY". The frog immediately began to play the piano. It played all the favorites, and some classical and then launched into contemporary jazz. The man ordered another beer, and when it came he reached into the cardboard box and pulled out a little white mouse. He set this mouse on top of the piano and said "SING". The frog began to play the piano and the mouse began to sing, first some 'oldies but goodies', then all of the current favorites.

A man at the bar who was watching all of this approached the drunk man and offered to buy this little outfit that he had. After a bit of negotiating, the drunk man agreed to sell it to the man for $500. The man gathered everything into the little cardboard box and ran out the door before the drunk could change his mind.

The bartender had been watching all of this goings on and said to the drunk "You damned old fool! You just sold that little outfit you had for $500 and you could have made millions off of it!" The drunk laughed heartily and replied "I am not the fool, the guy who bought it is. Do you really think I would have sold that if that mouse could really sing?"The bartender responded "What do you mean, I stood right here and listened to that mouse sing!" "The joke is on you and the guy who bought that outfit my friend", chuckled the drunk. "That mouse can't sing. The frog is a ventriloquist!"

"Oh, I've had a great day," replies Duey. "I've been in and out of puddles all day." The witty bartender says to the third duck, "So I guess your name is Louie?" The duck replies, "No, I'm Puddles."

A vampire bat came flapping in from the night covered in fresh blood and parked himself on the roof of the cave to get some sleep. Pretty soon all the other bats smelled the blood and began hassling him about where he got it. He told them to go away and let him get some sleep but they persisted until finally he gave in."OK, follow me" he said and flew out of the cave with hundreds of bats behind him. Down through the valley they went, across a river and into a forest full of trees. Finally he slowed down and all the other bats excitedly milled around him. "Now, do you see that tree over there?" he asked. "Yes, Yes, Yes!" the bats all screamed in a frenzy. "Good" said the bat, "Because I sure as hell didn't!"

Everybody I know who has a dog usually calls him "Rover" or "Spot". I call mine Sex. Now, Sex has been very embarrassing to me. When I went to the City Hall to renew the dog's license, I told the clerk that I would like a license for Sex. He said, "I would like to have one too!" Then I said, "But she is a dog!" He said he didn't care what she looked like. I said, "You don't understand. .

.. I have had Sex since I was nine years old." He replied, "You must have been quite a strong boy." When I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have Sex at the wedding.

He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, "But Sex has played a big part in my life and my whole world revolves around Sex." He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family was barred from the church from then on. When my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, "You don't understand. .

.. Sex keeps me awake at night." The clerk said, "Me too!" One day I entered Sex in a contest. But before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have Sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. "You don't understand," I said, "I hoped to have Sex on TV." He called me a show off. When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, "Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married but Sex left me after I was married." The Judge said, "Me too!" Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her. A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning. I said, "I'm looking for Sex." -- My case comes up next Thursday. Well now I've been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw.

Why just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist, she asked me, "What seems to be the trouble?" I replied, "Sex has been my best friend all my life but now it has left me for ever. I couldn't live any longer so lonely." and the doctor said, "Look mister, you should understand that sex isn't a man's best friend so get yourself a dog."

"I'm sorry sir.", said the ticket agent, "We don't allow animals in the theater."The old farmer went around the corner and stuffed the bird down his pants. He returned to the booth, bought a ticket and entered the theater. He sat down next to two old widows named Mildred and Marge.

The old farmer unzipped his pants so Chucky could stick his head out and watch the movie."Marge", whispered Mildred."What", said Marge."I think this guy next to me is a pervert.", said Mildred."What makes you think that", asked Marge."He unzipped his pants and he has his thing out", whispered Mildred."Well, don't worry about it", said Marge, "At our age we've seen them all."

A man was driving down a country road one day at 45 miles per hour when suddenly he noticed a 3-legged chicken running at the same speed beside his truck.

Though he thought this odd, the man decided to speed up so he wouldn't cause an accident with the chicken.

The man sped up to 55 miles per hour, but low and behold, so did the 3-legged chicken. The man then sped up to 65 miles per hour only to again be equaled in speed by the 3-legged chicken. As the man watched in amazement, the chicken suddenly made a sharp left turn and took off down a side road toward a small farm. The man quickly also made the left turn and followed the chicken to the small farm, parking out front. Looking around the man found the farmer around back in the midst of many 3-legged chickens.

After greeting the farmer, the man asked him why he was raising 3-legged chickens. "Well we figure," said the farmer, "that with an average family of 3 people, only 2 can have a chicken leg with an average chicken. But with a three legged chicken, each member of the family can enjoy a chicken leg of their own." "That's pretty wise," said the man, who then asked "Well how do your 3-legged chickens taste?"

"I don't know," said the farmer. "We've never been able to catch one."
####
Q:Why didn't the chicken cross the road?

A: because he was a "chicken".

Once upon a time in a nice little forest, there lived an orphaned bunny and an orphaned snake. By a surprising coincidence, both were blind from birth.

One day, the bunny was hopping through the forest, and the snake was slithering through the forest, when the bunny tripped over the snake and fell down. This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit."Oh, my," said the bunny, "I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I've been blind since birth, so I can't see where I'm going. In fact, since I'm also an orphan, I don't even know what I am."

"It's quite OK," replied the snake. "Actually, my story is much the same as yours. I, too, have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and find out what you are, so at least you'll have that going for you."

"Oh, that would be wonderful" replied the bunny. So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said, "Well, you're covered with soft fur, you have really long ears, your nose twitches, and you have a soft cottony tail. I'd say that you must be a bunny rabbit."

"Oh, thank you! Thank you," cried the bunny, in obvious excitement. The bunny suggested to the snake, "Maybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you've helped me."So the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, "Well, you're smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone, and no balls. I'd say you must be French".

Toilet TrickHey, this party was on April Fool's Day, so anything goes, right? Anyway, at the party there were two bathrooms. I went to the busiest one and did my usual medicine cabinet snooping and found some Icee Hot behind the mirror. So, on my way out I smeared the toilet seat with a thin layer of gel.

After I left, I got a beer but positioned myself so I could see if the next person out reacted. Yeah, baby!

The heat hit this chick as she was just leaving. Her eyes popped open and she did a 180 degree turn right back into the bathroom.

Good practical joke: priceless.

The Five Stages Of DrunkenessStage 1 - CLEVERThis is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known universe. You know you know everything and you want to pass on your knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always right. And, of course, the person you are talking to is very wrong. This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are CLEVER.

Stage 2 - ATTRACTIVEThis is when you realize that you are the most ATTRACTIVE person in the entire bar and that everyone fancies you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing that they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still CLEVER, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun.

Stage 3 - RICHThis is when you suddenly become the RICHEST person in the room. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have a bottomless wallet. You can also make bets at this stage because of course you are still CLEVER so, naturally, you will always win. Anyway, it doesn't matter how much you bet because you are RICH. You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, in the knowledge that you are clearly the most ATTRACTIVE person present.

Stage 4 - INVINCIBLEYou are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone, especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because you are now INVINCIBLE. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge them to a battle of wits or strength. You have no fear of losing this battle, because as well as being INVINCIBLE you are CLEVER, you're RICH and you're more ATTRACTIVE than them anyway.

Stage 5 - INVISIBLEThis is the final stage of drunkenness. At this point you can do anything, because you are now INVISIBLE. You can dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You can also snob the face off them for the same reason. You are also INVISIBLE to the people who want to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still CLEVER you know all the words.

THE FIVE STAGES OF SOBERING UPStage 1 - STUPIDAs you regain consciousness and begin to enjoy the headache, the churning stomach and the cold sweats, you realize that you have lost not only several hours of your life, but also the ability to concentrate on anything at all. You are now STUPID and will remain so for a minimum of 12 hours.

Stage 2 - UGLYNever entirely happy with the effects of the bathroom mirror, the first thing you are horrified to discover is that you have now become even UGLIER than you previously thought possible. Not only have you got bloodshot eyes and a glorious collection of spots but you are shaking so much that your grandfather probably looks healthier. Unfortunately you are still too STUPID to know better than to try to shave while still shaking.

Stage 3 - POORHaving crawled out of bed and got dressed, you are about to shamble out the door when you discover that the money that was to last you the week is now missing from your wallet. Being STUPID, you have no idea what happened to it but the traces of pizza on your clothes allow the possibility that you might have treated everyone to a takeout at some point. Alternatively your pocket could have been picked or you might have given the taxi driver a fifty dollar note by mistake. Rationionalizing that you couldn't possibly have been that STUPID and that you would remember being robbed, you come to believe that you were the only one who bought any food or drinks all night and start to loathe all your friends.

Stage 4 - FRAGILEAs you are now STUPID, UGLY and POOR, your consequently FRAGILE self-esteem plummets. Your already FRAGILE physical condition ensures that you feel liable to shatter if anyone even speaks to you.

Stage 5 - CONSPICUOUSThis is the final stage of sobering up. Unfortunately, everyone can spot this CONSPICUOUS condition and its cause from a great distance. Even worse, they know that they can complete your misery by making fun of you, and that you are too STUPID to retaliate, too FRAGILE to hit them, too POOR to bribe them and too UGLY to hide.

The bartender yells, "What's all the screaming about in there? You're scaring my customers!"

There was a guy in a bar one night that got really drunk. I mean really, really, really drunk. When the bar closed he got up to go home. As he stumbled out the door he saw a nun walking on the sidewalk. So he stumbled over to the nun and punched her in the face. Well the nun was really surprised but before she could do or say anything he punched her again. This time she fell down and he stumbled over to her and kicked her in the butt.

Then he picked her up and threw her into a wall. By this time the nun was pretty weak and couldn't move.

So then he stumbled over to her, put his face right next to hers and said. "Not very strong tonight, are you Batman?"
####
A fellow decides to take off early from work and go drinking. He stays until the bar closes at 2am, at which time he is extremely drunk. When he enters his house, he doesn't want to wake anyone, so he takes off his shoes and starts tip-toeing up the stairs.

Half-way up the stairs, he falls over backwards and lands flat on his rear end. That wouldn't have been so bad, except that he had couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke, and the broken glass carved up his buttocks terribly. But,

he was so drunk that he didn't know he was hurt. A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he noticed blood,

so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up something terrible. Well, he repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed.

The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting, and he was hunkering under the covers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom."Well, you really tied one on last night," she said."Where'd you go?" "I worked late," he said, "and I stopped off for a couple of beers."

"A couple of beers? That's a laugh," she replied, "You got plastered last night. Where the heck did you go?"

"What makes you so sure I got drunk last night,

anyway?"

"Well," she replied, "my first big clue was when I got up this morning and found a bunch of band-aids stuck to the mirror."

A guy walks into a bar and sits down. He starts dialing numbers like there's a telephone in his hand, then puts his palm up against his cheek and begins talking. Suspicious, the bartender walks over and tells him this is a very tough neighborhood and he doesn't need any trouble here. The guy says, "You don't understand. I'm very hi-tech. I had a phone installed in my hand because I was tired of carrying the cellular." The bartender says "Prove it." The guy dials up a number and hands his hand to the bartender. The bartender talks into the hand and carries on a conversation. "That's incredible!" says the bartender. "I would never have believed it!" "Yeah", said the guy, "I can keep in touch with my broker, my wife, you name it. By the way, where is the men's room?" The bartender directs him to the men's room. The guy goes in and 5, 10, 20 minutes go by and he doesn't return. Fearing the worst given the neighborhood, the bartender goes into the men's room to check on the guy. The guy is spread-eagled up against the wall. His pants are pulled down and he has a roll of toilet paper up his butt. "Oh my god!" said the bartender. "Did they rob you? Are you hurt?" The guy turns and says: "No, no, I'm ok. I'm just waiting for a fax."

A drunk walked into a tavern, sat down at the bar. He placed a small cardboard box on the bar, and ordered a beer. When the beer came, he opened the box, pulled out a tiny piano and bench and set them on the bar, then ordered another beer. When the beer came, he reached into the box, pulled out a frog, sat him on the piano bench and said, "PLAY". The frog immediately began to play the piano. It played all the favorites, and some classical and then launched into contemporary jazz. The man ordered another beer, and when it came he reached into the cardboard box and pulled out a little white mouse. He set this mouse on top of the piano and said "SING". The frog began to play the piano and the mouse began to sing, first some 'oldies but goodies', then all of the current favorites.

A man at the bar who was watching all of this approached the drunk man and offered to buy this little outfit that he had. After a bit of negotiating, the drunk man agreed to sell it to the man for $500. The man gathered everything into the little cardboard box and ran out the door before the drunk could change his mind.

The bartender had been watching all of this goings on and said to the drunk "You damned old fool! You just sold that little outfit you had for $500 and you could have made millions off of it!" The drunk laughed heartily and replied "I am not the fool, the guy who bought it is. Do you really think I would have sold that if that mouse could really sing?"The bartender responded "What do you mean, I stood right here and listened to that mouse sing!" "The joke is on you and the guy who bought that outfit my friend", chuckled the drunk. "That mouse can't sing. The frog is a ventriloquist!"

During late spring one year, a blonde was trying out her new boat. She was unable to have her boat perform, travel through water, or do any maneuvers whatsoever no matter how hard she tried.

After trying for over three days to make it work properly, she decided to seek help. She putted the boat over to the local marina in hopes that someone there could identify her problem.

Workers determined that everything from the engine to the outdrive was working perfectly on the topside of the boat.

Under the boat, still strapped in place securely, was the trailer.

The 12 fiddlers fiddling have all come down with VD from fiddling with the 10 ladies dancing, the 11 lords leaping have knocked up the 8 maids a-milking, and the 9 pipers-piping have been arrested for doing weird things to the 7 swans a-swimming The 6 geese a-laying, 4 calling birds, 3 French hens, 2 turtle doves and the partridge in a pear tree have me up to my sled runners in bird shit. On top of all this! Mrs. Claus is going through menopause, 8 of my reindeer are in heat, the elves have joined the gay liberation and some people who can't read a calendar have scheduled Christmas for the 5th of January. Maybe next year I will be able to get my shit together and bring you the things you want. This year I suggest you get your asses down to Walmart before everything is gone. Love, Santa

When I was a young turkey, new to the coop, my big brother Tom took me out on the stoop, then he sat me down, and he spoke real slow, and he told me there was something that I had to know. His look and his tone I will always remember, when he told me of the horrors of.

..

. Black November. "Come around August, now listen to me, each day you'll get six meals instead of just three, and soon you'll be thick, where once you were thin, and you'll grow a big rubbery thing under your chin. And then one morning, when you're warm in your bed, in will burst the farmer's wife, and hack off your head, Then she'll pluck out all your feathers so you're bald 'n pink, and scoop out all your insides and leave ya lyin' in the sink. And then comes the worst part", he said not bluffing, "She'll spread your cheeks and pack your rear with stuffing". Well, the rest of his words were too grim to repeat, and as I sat on the stoop like a winged piece of meat, I decided on the spot that to avoid being cooked, I'd have to lay low and remain overlooked. I began a new diet of nuts and granola, high-roughage salads, juice and diet cola. And as they ate pastries, chocolates and crepes, I stayed in my room doing my fitness tapes. I maintained my weight of two pounds and a half, and tried not to notice when the bigger birds laughed. But 'twas I who was laughing, under my breath, as they chomped and they chewed, ever closer to death. And sure enough when Black November rolled around, I was the last turkey left in the entire compound. So now I'm a pet in the farmer's wife's lap. I haven't a worry, so I eat and I nap. She held me today, while sewing and humming, and smiled at me and said.

..

.. "Christmas is coming.

.."

A German, an American, and a Mexican are traveling in the Amazon, and they get captured.

The head of the tribe says to the German, "What do you want on your back for your whipping?"The German responds, "I will take oil!" So they put oil on his back, and a large Amazon whips him ten times. When he is finished the German has these huge welts on his back, and he can hardly move.

The Amazons haul the German away, and say to the Mexican, "What do you want on your back?" "I will take nothing!" says the Mexican, and he stands there straight and takes his ten lashings without a single flinch."What will you take on your back?" the Amazons ask the American. He responds, "I'll take the Mexican."

An Englishman, Frenchman, Mexican, and Texan were flying across country on a small plane when the pilot comes on the loud speaker and says, "We're having mechanical problems and the only way we can make it to the next airport is for 3 of you to open the door and jump. At least one of you will survive."The four open the door and look out below. The Englishman takes a deep breath and hollers, "God Save The Queen," and jumps.

The Frenchman gets really inspired and hollers, "Viva La France," and he also jumps.

This really pumps up the Texan so he hollers, "Remember the Alamo," and he grabs the Mexican and throws him out of the plane.

A nerd was walking on campus one day when his friend, another nerd, rode up on an incredible shiny new bicycle. The first nerd was stunned and asked, "Where did you get such a nice bike?"The second nerd replied, "Well, yesterday I was walking home minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up to me on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, 'Take what you want!

A truck driver hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers stops in a bar for a beer. As he approaches the bar he sees a big sign on the door saying "NERDS NOT ALLOWED-ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!" He goes in and sits down. The bartender comes over to him, sniffs, and says, "You smell kind of nerdy, and just what do you do for a living?" The truck driver says, "I drive a truck, and the smell is just from the computers I'm hauling." The bartender says, "OK, truck drivers are not nerds," and serves him a beer. As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver asks, "Why did you do that?" The bartender said, "Oh, don't worry, the nerds are over-populating the Silicon Valley, and are in season now. You don't even need a license." So the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, And heads back onto the freeway. Suddenly he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up the computers. They are all engineers, accountants and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. He can't let them steal his whole load. So remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop. The truck driver said, "What's wrong? I thought nerds were in season." "Sure," said the patrolman, "But you can't bait 'em."

Three engineers and three accountants are traveling by train to a conference. At the station, the three accountants each buy tickets and watch as the three engineers buy only a single ticket."How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?" asks an accountant. "Watch and you'll see," answers an engineer. They all board the train. The accountants take their respective seats but all three engineers cram into a restroom and close the door behind them.

Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the restroom door and says, "Ticket, please." The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on.

The accountants saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea. So after the conference, the accountants decide to copy the engineers on the return trip and save some money (being clever with money, and all). When they get to the station they buy a single ticket for the return trip.

To their astonishment, the engineers don't buy a ticket at all. "How are you going to travel without a ticket?" says one perplexed accountant. "Watch and you'll see," answers an engineer. When they board the train the three accountants cram into a restroom and the three engineers cram into another one nearby. The train departs.

Shortly afterward, one of the engineers leaves his restroom and walks over to the restroom where the accountants are hiding. He knocks on the door and says, "Ticket, please."

There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.

5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each. Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.

7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house. Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are not talking about 0.

78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.

5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second - 3,

000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a pokey 27.

4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that flying reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them -Santa would need 360,

000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,

000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). A mass of nearly 600,

000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.

3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.

26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reaches the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.

p.

s. in .

001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,

000 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim considering all the high calorie snacks he must have consumed over the years) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,

315,

015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now. MERRY CHISTMAS!

An old man lived alone in Ireland. He wanted to dig his potato garden, but it was very hard work.

His only son, who would have helped him, was in prison for bank robbery. The old man wrote a letter to his son and mentioned his predicament.

Shortly, he received this reply,"For HEAVEN'S SAKE Dad, don't dig up that garden, that's where I buried the Money!"At 4 A.

M. the next morning, a dozen policemen showed up and dug up the entire garden, without finding any money.

Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what happened, and asking him what to do next.

His son's reply was: "Now plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best I could do from here."

A Chinese man walks into a bar in America late one night and he seesSteven Spielberg. As he was a great fan of his movies, he rushes over to him, and asks for his autograph. Instead, Spielberg gives him a slap and says, "You Chinese peoplebombed our Pearl Habour, get outta here." The astonished Chinese man replied, "It was not the Chinese who bombed your Pearl Harbour, it was the Japanese"."Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese your all the same," replied Spielberg.

In return, the Chinese man gives Spielberg a slap and says, "You sank the Titanic, my forefathers were on that ship." Shocked, Spielberg replies, "It was the iceberg that sank the ship, not me." The Chinese man, replies, "Iceberg, Spielberg, Carsberg, you're all the same."

Three patients in a mental institution prepare for an examination given by the head psychiatrist. If the patients pass the exam, they will be free to leave the hospital. However, if they fail, the institution will detain them for seven years.

The doctor takes the three patients to the top of a diving board overlooking an empty swimming pool, and asks the first patient to jump.

The first patient jumps head first into the pool and breaks both arms.

Then the second patient jumps and breaks both legs.

The third patient looks over the side and refuses to jump. "Congratulations! You're a free man. Just tell me why didn't you jump?" asked the doctor.

To which the third patient answered, "Well Doc, I can't swim!"

And God populated the earth with broccoli and cauliflower and spinach and green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.

And Satan created McDonald's, and McDonald's brought forth the $3.

20 double-cheeseburger, and Satan said to Man, "You want fries with that?", and Man said, "Super size them."And Man gained pounds.

And God created the healthful yogurt, that Woman might keep her figure that Man found so fair.

And Satan froze the yogurt, and he brought forth chocolate, nuts and brightly colored sprinkle candy to put on the yogurt.

And Woman gained pounds.

And God said, "Try my crispy fresh salad."And Satan brought forth creamy dressings, bacon bits, and shredded cheese, and there was ice cream for dessert.

And Woman gained pounds.

And God said, "I have sent you heart-healthy vegetables and olive oil with which to cook them."And Satan brought forth chicken- fried steak so big it needed its own platter.

And Man gained pounds, and his cholesterol went through the roof.

And God brought forth running shoes, and Man resolved to lose those extra pounds.

And Satan brought forth cable TV with remote control so Man would not have to work to change channels.

And Man gained pounds.

And God said, "You're running up the score, Devil."And God brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.

And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy centre into chips and deep-fat fried them. He created sour cream dip also, and Man clutched his remote control, and ate the potato chips swaddled in cholesterol.

And Satan saw that and said, "It is good."And Man went into cardiac arrest.

And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

And Satan created private health insurance .

Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and Al Gore were in an airplane that crashed. Now they're in heaven, and God is sitting on the great golden throne. God addresses Al first. "Al, what do you believe in?" Al replies, "Well, I believe that the internal combustion Engine is the root of all evil and that we need to save the world from CFCs and that if any more freon is used, the whole earth will become a greenhouse and we'll all die." God thinks for a second and says, "Okay, I can live with that. Come and sit at my left." God then addresses Bill Clinton. "Bill, what do you believe in?" Bill Clinton replies, "Well, I believe in power to the people. I think people should be able to make their own choices about things, and that no one should ever be able to tell someone else what to do. I also believe in feeling people's pain, but not inhaling." God thinks for a second and says, "Okay, that sounds good. Come and sit at my right." God then addresses Bill Gates. "Bill Gates, what do you believe in?"

A lead hardware engineer, a lead software engineer, and their program manager are taking a walk outdoors during their lunch break when they come upon an old brass lamp. They pick it up and dust it off. Poof -- out pops a genie."Thank you for releasing me from my lamp-prison. I can grant you 3 wishes. Since there are 3 of you I will grant one wish to each of you."The hardware engineer thinks a moment and says, "I'd like to be sailing a yacht across the Pacific, racing before the wind, with an all-girl crew."

"It is done", said the Genie, and poof, the hardware engineer disappears.

The software engineer thinks a moment and says, "I'd like to be riding my Harley with a gang of beautiful women throughout the American Southwest."

"It is done", said the Genie, and poof, the software engineer disappears.

The program manager looks at where the other two had been standing and rubs his chin in thought. Then he tells the Genie, "I'd like those two back in the office after lunch."

Microsoft announced that it is selling advertising space in the error messages that appear in Windows. Acknowledging for the first time that the average user of their operating system encounters error messages at least several times a day, Microsoft is trying to take financial advantage of the unavoidable opportunity to make an ad impression. "We estimate that throughout the world at any given moment several million people are getting a "general protection fault" or "illegal operation" warning. We will be able to generate significant revenue by including a short advertising message along with it," said Microsoft marketing director Nathan Mirror. The Justice Department immediately indicated that they intend to investigate whether Microsoft is gaining an unfair advantage in reaching the public with this advertising by virtue of its semi-monopolistic control over error messages.

DOS Beer: Requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only came in an 8-oz. can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is divided into 8 compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately. Soon to be discontinued, although a lot of people are going to keep drinking it after it's no longer available.

Mac Beer: At first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered by many to be a "light" beer. All the cans look identical. When you take one from the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the can. If you call to ask about the ingredients, you are told that "you don't need to know." A notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan.

Windows 3.

1 Beer: The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like Mac Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will explode when you open it.

OS/2 Beer: Comes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.

1 Beer simultaneously too, but somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when you open them, even if you shake them up. You never really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the manufacturer (International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9 million six-packs have been sold.

Windows 95 Beer: You can't buy it yet, but a lot of people have taste-tested it and claim it's wonderful. The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like Windows 3.

1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside, the cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep drinking Windows 3.

1 Beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients list, when you look at the small print, has some of the same ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an entirely new brew.

Windows NT Beer: Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This causes most people to have to go out and buy bigger refrigerators. The can looks just like Windows 3.

1 Beer's, but the company promises to change the can to look just like Windows 95 Beer's - after Windows 95 beer starts shipping. Touted as an "industrial strength" beer, and suggested only for use in bars.

Unix Beer: Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 oz. Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical. Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you either need a complete set of instructions or a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for several years.

AmigaDOS Beer: The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. This beer never really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too. When this can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.

VMS Beer: Requires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and sipping. However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or contain extremely un-beer-like contents. Best drunk in high pressure development environments. When you call the manufacturer for the list of ingredients, you're told that is proprietary and referred to an unknown listing in the manuals published by the FDA. Rumors are that this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.

When Mary didn't stir, little Johnny, an altruistic boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. "God Almighty !" shouted Mary.

A secretary for a foreign embassy was entertaining a wealthy foreign ambassador during lunch at a very expensive restaurant in uptown New York.

The ambassador was so enthralled by the beauty and presence of this secretary that he asked her to marry him. The secretary was startled, but remembered that her boss told her never to insult foreign dignitaries, so she decided to let him down easy. "I'll only marry you under three conditions." she said."Anything, anything," said the ambassador."First, you must buy me a 14-karat gold wedding band with a 72 carat diamond, along with a 28 inch studded matching necklace for our engagement."Without hesitation, the ambassador picked up his cellular phone, called his personal accountant, told him the instructions, and said, "Yes, yes, I buy, I buy!" The secretary thought that her first request was too easy, so she thought of a more difficult situation."Second, I want you to build me a 58-acre mansion in the richest part of the Poconos along with a 40 acre summer home in the sweetest vineyards of France." The ambassador picked up his phone, called his personal broker in New York, then called another broker in France, and after his quick conversation, he said, "Yes, yes, I build, I build!" The secretary was very startled, and knew she must think of a final request that would be impossible to live up to. "Finally," she said. "I'll only marry you, if you have a 10 inch tool."A sad face befell the ambassador, and he cupped his face in his hands. After weeping in his native language for a few minutes, the ambassador slowly lifted his head and said, "Ok, ok, I cut, I cut!"

It is recounted that at King?

s College in the Strand around the time of the war, the Chief of Services would inevitably begin the year?

s rounds by teaching "a singularly important principle of medicine." He asked a nurse to fetch him a sample of urine. He then talked at length about diabetes mellitus. "Diabetes," he said, "is a Greek name; but the Romans noticed that the bees like the urine of diabetics, so they added the word mellitus which means sweet as honey. Well, as you know, you may find sugar in the urine of a diabetic.

.."By now, the nurse had returned with a sample of urine which the registrar promptly held up like a trophy. We stared at that straw colored fluid as if we had never seen such a thing before. The registrar then startled us. He dipped a finger boldly into the urine, then licked his finger with the tip of his tongue. As if tasting wine, he opened and closed his lips rapidly. Could he perhaps detect a faint taste of sugar? The sample was passed on to us for an opinion. We all dipped a finger into the fluid, all of us foolishly licked that finger."Now," said the Registrar grinning, "you have learned the first principle of diagnosis. I mean the power of observation."We were baffled. We stood near the sluice room outside the ward, and in the distance, some anonymous patient was explosively coughing. "You see," the registrar said continuing triumphantly, "I dipped my MIDDLE finger into the urine, but licked my INDEX finger, not like all you chaps."

Passengers on a small commuter plane are waiting for the flight to leave. The entrance opens, and two men walk up the aisle, dressed in pilots' uniforms--both are wearing dark glasses, one is using a seeing-eye dog, and the other is tapping his way up the aisle with a cane. Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin; but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start up. The passengers begin glancing nervously around, searching for some sign that this just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming. The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and people at the windows realize that they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport territory. As it begins to look as though the plane will never take off, that it will plow into the water, panicked screams fill the cabin--but at that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air. The passengers relax and laugh a little sheepishly, and soon they have all retreated into their magazines, secure in the knowledge that the plane is in good hands. Up in the cockpit, the copilot turns to the pilot and says, "You know, Bob, one of these days, they're going to scream too late, and we're all gonna die. . ."

She is wearing a fireman's hat and has the wagon tied to a dog. The fireman says "Hey little girl. What are you doing?" The little girl says "I'm pretending to be a fireman and this is my fire truck!" The fireman walks over to take a closer look. "Little girl that sure is a nice fire truck!" the fireman says. "Thanks mister" says the little girl. The fireman looks a little closer and notices the little girl has tied the dog to the wagon by its testicles. "Little girl", says the fireman, "I don't want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if you were to tie that rope around the dog's neck I think you could go faster." The little girl says, "You're probably right mister, but then I wouldn't have a siren!

I'm so glad that this is my last child support payment. Month after month, year after year, those payments! So I called my baby girl, Kareesha, to come over to my house, and when she got there, I said to her, "Baby girl, I want you to take this last check over to your mother's house and tell her that this is the last check she's ever going to get from me, and I want you to come back and tell me the expression that's on her face." So my baby girl took the check over to her. I was really anxious to hear what she had to say and what she looked like.

. As my baby girl walked through the door, I said, "Now what did she have to say?" "She told me to tell you that you ain't my daddy, and to watch the expression on your face.

Always wear clean underwear in public, especially when working under you vehicle.

.. From the NORTHWEST FLORIDA Daily News comes this story of a Crestview couple who drove their car to Wal-Mart, only to have their car break down in the parking lot. The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car in the lot. The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection, she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones. Unable to stand the embarrassment, she dutifully stepped forward, quickly put her hand UP his shorts, and tucked everything back into place. On regaining her feet, she looked across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by. The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his forehead.

But to tell you the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained in the past. I'm not sure it'd be worth it to you." "No problem," the tired travelers assured him. "I'll take it." The next morning Dave came down to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy tailed. "How'd you sleep?" asked the manager. "Never better." The manager was impressed. "No problem with the other guy snoring, then?" "Nope, I shut him up in no time" said Dave. "How'd you manage that?" asked the manager. "He was already in bed, snoring away, when I came in the room," Dave explained." I went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, said, 'Goodnight, beautiful,

A man wanted a big, verocious dog to protect his business, so he visited a kennel that specialized in attack dogs. The man explained to the kennel owner that he wanted the biggest, meanest, most vicious dog in the kennel, and the owner offered to take the man on a tour of the premises.

After they had been walking for a few minutes, they came upon a large dog. He was snarling loudly and biting and clawing at the cage."He looks like he'd be a pretty good attack dog," said the buyer."Well, he's not bad," replied the owner, "but I have something better in mind for you."They continued walking around the premises, and after a while they found an even larger, meaner dog than the first. He snarled at the two men and tried to bite them through the wire on his cage."Ah," said the buyer, "This must be the dog you were referring to earlier."

"Well, no." said the owner. "I have something better in mind for you."The men continued their tour. Eventually, they came upon a fairly large dog that was lying quietly on his side, licking his butt. He did not seem to notice as the men approached."This is the dog I had in mind for you," said the owner.

The buyer was flabbergasted. "You're joking!" he exclaimed."This dog seems quite tame; he doesn't act at all like an attack dog at all. Hell, he's just lying there, licking his butt!"

"I know, I know," said the owner. "But you see, he just ate a lawyer, and he's trying to get the taste out of his mouth."

After a trip to the bathroom he was able to make his way downstairs, where his wife put some coffee in front of him. "Louise," he moaned, "Tell me what went on last night. Was it as bad as I think?"

"Even worse," she assured him in her most scornful tone. "You made a complete ass of yourself. You succeeded in antagonizing the entire board of directors, and insulted the chairman of the company to his face." "He's an arrogant, self-important prick, piss on him!" "You did.

One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. "Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10." Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.

After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: "You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks." Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: "Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better."

A mother was working in the kitchen listening to her son playing with his new electric train in the living room.

She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of bitches who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks."The horrified mother went in and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house!

! Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language."Two hours later, the son came out of the bedroom and resumed playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon."She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today."As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen."

The pharmacist says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants."Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot. I want the condoms because I think tonight's "the night"."We're having dinner with her parents, and then we're going out. And I've got a feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that. Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack."The young man makes his purchase and leaves. Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her parents. He asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree.

He begins the prayer, but continues praying with his head down for several minutes after everyone starts eating.

At the Russian War College, the general is a guest lecturer and tells the class of officers that the session will focus on potential problems and the resulting strategies. One of the officers in the class begins by asking the first question, "Will we have to fight a World War Three?" "Yes, comrades, looks like you will," answers the general. "And who will be our enemy, Comrade General?" another officer asks. "The likelihood is that it will be China." The class looks alarmed, and finally one officer asks, "But Comrade General, we are 150 million people and they are about 1.

5 billion. How can we possibly win?" "Well," replies the general, "Think about it. In modern war, it is not the quantity, but the quality that is the key. For example, in the Middle East, 5 million Jews fight against 50 million Arabs, and the Jews have been the winners every time." "But sir," asks the panicky officer, "Do we have enough Jews"?

50 Ways To Annoy Osama bin Laden.

.. Fifty Ways To Annoy Osama bin Laden If You're Invited To A Dinner Party At His Secret Afghan Lair, by Alan MeissPoint out the lice in his beard to make him feel self-conscious. Pause for a moment, listen carefully, and say, "Doesn't that sound a lot like a B-52?" Ask him if he's looking forward to replacing Hitler as Satan's favorite chew toy in the lowest inferno of Hell. Tell him all about your great vacation to Saudi Arabia, where you went absolutely everywhere and did everything, just stomped all over the place. Use his satellite phone to call the time and weather line in Buenos Aires and leave it off the hook. Tell him how much less you paid for your Kalashnikov rifle. Now that you know the address of his secret cave hideout, fill out magazine subscription cards for him for the Wine Spectator and Penthouse. But do not, under any circumstances, send him Popular Mechanics. Order him ten Domino's pizzas with extra ham topping. Correct him when he ends a sentence with a preposition. Ask whether the Taliban gets cable, because you haven't seen "Sex and the City" for weeks. Yank the end of his turban really hard to make him spin around like a top. Switch all the CD's in the jewel boxes in his CD collection, so that when he reaches for Michael Bolton, he'll actually get the Oak Ridge Boys. Mine his bathroom. Use your dinner fork for your salad, and, if questioned by your host, mutter something about "spots". Leave business cards for the Israeli Mossad in his Rolodex. Take pictures of all his wives and post them on www.

amihotornot.

com. Ask him if he wears boxers or briefs. Check. Take pictures. Again, post these on www.

amihotornot.

com. Give him a Hot Chicks of Palestine calendar. Ask him if Paradise is different for each person, and whether in your own paradise you'll get to, "kick his ass every day for eternity." Reset his VCR and leave it blinking 12:00. Refer to him as "Osama-osama-fee-fi-fo-fama bin Laden." Ask whether suicide bombers have to pay union dues. Tell him it's lovely what he's done with his cave, but that it'd look much nicer covered with huge, smoking craters. At dinner, imply that the Northern Alliance has much prettier place settings. Claim you once saw him at a Hooter's in Muncie wearing a yarmulke. Ask him if he wouldn't mind if you opened the door and shined your laser pointer on his forehead for a few minutes. Tell him that this is the worst pajama party you've ever attended. Ask for some pork rinds and a good brew to wash them down. Mix up his Rubik's Cube. Ask him if he provides his employees with a 401K plan. Compliment him on all his poppies outside, but mention that a few day lilies would be a nice accent. Run your finger along his credenza, and say, "tsk, tsk" if there's dust. Ask whether the Taliban is hoping to be bombed ahead into the Stone Age, or perhaps the Iron Age if enough shell casings survive. Explain that America is a land of freedom and opportunity, filled with people of every race, religion, and background, including millions of women strong enough to knock the crap out of him. Claim that they serve much better falafel at the public executions in Sudan. Ask him if he's pursuing the Lesser Jihad, the Greater Jihad, or the "Completely Whacked Out of his Freaking Gourd" Jihad. Swirl your drink thoughtfully and mention, "Just think, in a few weeks you might fit in this glass!" Check to see if Saddam is on his speed-dial list. They have to wait a few years to see current television shows in Afghanistan, so give away the secret of who's having a baby on "Friends." Warn him that you're "in a New York state of mind." Mention that his wives look quite fetching in their burkas, and ask whether they've ever thought of modeling. Ask him, "Say, where do you keep all those Stinger missiles?" just in case he'll be caught off guard and answer correctly. Give him a "noogie" or a "wedgie." If there's actually still a flush toilet left in Afghanistan, give him a "swirlie".

* Ask to borrow his hedge trimmer and never give it back. Play a game of Monopoly with him. Make him play the thimble. See if he charges interest. Claim that his properties are your "holy lands" and blow up his hotels. Fish out the secret toy surprises in all his cereal boxes. Offer to take him "clubbing" in Tel Aviv with your friends Saul and Ivan. Ask him which Ninja Turtle is his favorite. Give him your cell phone as a gift and ask him to leave it on for a few days so your friends can call and say hi. When you leave, wave and say, "Shalom!"copyright 2001 by Alan Meiss

One day, President Bush visited an elementary school. All the kids were so excited to get to meet the President. He began to talk to them and asked them to define the word "tragedy." "Well," one girl replied, "If my mommy ran over my dog, Rover, that would be a tragedy!" The President smiled at the little girl and said, "No, sweetie. That would be an accident! Can anyone give it a try?" A little boy sitting across the room raised his hand and said, "I know! I know! If our bus driver ran off of a cliff and killed everyone!" The President shook his head and said, "No son. That would be a great loss! Doesn't anyone know of a good example of a tragedy?" A small girl raised her hand and said, "Well, Mr. President, if you and Laura were in Air Force One and it was hit by a missile and blown to smithereens, most people would think that that was a tragedy!" "Very good," he said. "And what was your reason for that answer?" "Well," she said, "It would not be an accident and it sure would not be a great loss!"

Three guys, a Canadian, Osama bin Laden, and George W. Bush are out walking together one day. They came across a lantern and a genie pops out of it. "I will give each of you one wish. That's three wishes total," saidthe genie. The Canadian said, "I'm a farmer, my dad was a farmer, and my son will also farm. I want the land to be forever fertile in Canada." With a blink of the genie's eye, *POOF* the land in Canada was forever made fertile for farming. Bin Laden was amazed, so he said, "I want a wall around Afghanistan, so that no infidels, Jews, or Americans can come into our precious state." Again, with a blink of the genie's eye, *POOF* there was a huge wall around Afghanistan. George W. Bush, said, "I'm very curious, please tell me more about this wall." The Genie explains, "Well, it's about 15,

000 feet high, 500 feet thick, and completely surrounds the country; nothing can get in or out - it's virtually impenetrable." George W. Bush says, "Fill it with water."

Back when Bill Clinton and Hillary got married Bill told her, "There's one thing I want you to know. There's a box under my bed, and I don't want you to look in it until I die." Hillary agreed to this but, over the years, the curiosity got the better of her, and she finally looked in it. She found three beer cans and 1.

5 million dollars in cash. When she asked Bill what the beer cans were for, he replied, "Well, those are for all the times I've cheated on you." Hillary said, "Well, that's not bad after all these years, and you being a politician, and traveling and all." She was about to leave, but then she said, "Hey, Bill, what about the 1.

5 million dollars?" Bill replied, "That's for all the times the box got full and I had to cash the cans in."

They drove around for hours, and it soon became late. The driver was geting rather tired and found it difficult to keep his eyes open.

Suddenly, the limo hit a huge bump and and the two men heard a terrible scream.

The limo driver stopped the car immediatly to see what had happened. Bill Clinton soon got out of the car also, to investigate. "What happened?

!" asked Bill. "I ran over a pig," replied his driver. Bill Clinton looked horrified. "Well go over to that farmhouse and tell them what you did. That pig could have been their's." So the driver walked over to the farmhouse and knocked on the door. Bill Clinton waited in the limo for nearly 2 and a half hours. Finally, the limo driver came back and got back into the car.

Is It Better To Be a Jock or a Nerd?

$ Michael Jordan having "retired," with $40 million in endorsements, makes $178,

$ If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make $618 while boiling it.

$ He makes $7,

415/hr more than minimum wage.

$ He'll make $3,

710 while watching each episode of Friends.

$ If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,

000) it would take him a whole 12 hours.

$ If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.

00 every second.

$ He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be reimbursed $33,

390 for that round.

$ Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15% of his income into a tax deferred account (401k), his contributions will hit the federal cap of $9500 at 8:30 a.

60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the Olympics, and about $15,

A guy walked into a pro-shop with a gorilla. "Is anyone interested in a little wager?" he said, flashing some large bills around. "I've got $500.

00 here that says my gorilla can hit the ball longer and straighter than anybody here at this club. In fact, he hits it 500 yards right down the middle . . . every time!" Everyone in the pro-shop started laughing. After a moment, the newest pro at the club and the longest hitter in the area spoke up, "I gotta see this!" he said. "You know, what? I'll take you up on that wager! Meet you on the first tee." When they reached the 585-yard par-5 first tee the trainer led the gorilla to the tee box, put a driver in his hands, set a tee in the ground. The gorilla did the rest. Sure enough, he smashed his drive right down the middle and clear out of sight. When the ball finally came to rest it was on the green -- 6 inches from the cup. The pro was astonished. "That's incredible!" he exclaimed. "How did you train him to hit the ball like that!" There's no need for me to tee off. I couldn't beat him with a stick. Here's your money." As the pro walked off the green, still shaking his head, he turned back to the trainer and said, "Oh, by the way, how does he putt?" The trainer responded, "Just like he drives: 500 yards. Right down the middle. Every time."

They shook on it. Sadly, a few months later poor Abe passed on. One day soon afterward, Sol was sitting there feeding the pigeons by himself when he heard a voice whisper, "Sol.

Husband 3 was from field services; he said everything checked out diagnostically, but he just couldn't get the system up. Husband 4 was in telemarketing; even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver. Husband 5 was an engineer; he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method. Husband 6 was from finance and administration; he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not. Husband 7 was in marketing; although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it. Husband 8 was a psychologist; all he ever did was talk about it. Husband 9 was a gynecologist; all he did was look at it. Husband 10 was a stamp collector; all he ever did was.

.. God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!" "Good," said the new husband, "but, why?" "You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed!"

A man boarded an airplane and took his seat. As he settled in, he glanced up and saw an unusually beautiful woman boarding the plane.

He soon realized she was heading straight toward his seat. Lo and behold, she took the seat right beside his.

Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, "Business trip or vacation?"She turned, smiled, and said, "Business. The annual Sexual Education Convention in Chicago."He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen, sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting for sex education!

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, "What's your business role at this convention?"

"Lecturer," she responded. "I use my experience to debunk some of thepopular myths about sexuality." "Really," he said. "What myths arethose?"

"Well," she explained. "One popularmyth is that African American menare the most well endowed, when infact, it's the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait." "Another popular myth is that French men are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.

We have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is the Southern Redneck."Suddenly, the woman became a littleuncomfortable and blushed. "I'm sorry", she said. "I shouldn't really be discussing this with you. I don't even know your name."

"Tonto," the man said. "Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba."

There were two nuns.

..

One of them was known as Sister Mathematical (SM), and the other one was known as Sister Logical (SL).

It is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent.

SM: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past thirty-eight and a half minutes? I wonder what he wants.

SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.

SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most? What can we do?

SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.

SM: It's not working.

SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical thing. He started to walk faster, too.

SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.

SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go this way. He cannot follow us both.

So the man decided to follow Sister Logical.

Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried about what has happened to Sister Logical.

Then Sister Logical arrives.

SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!

SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both, so he followed me.

SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then?

SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast as I could and he started to run as fast as he could.

SM: And?

SL: The only logical thing happened. He reached me.

SM: Oh, dear! What did you do?

SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up.

SM: Oh, Sister! What did the man do?

SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants.

SM: Oh, no! What happened then?

SL: Isn't it logical, Sister?

A nun with her dress up can run faster than man with his pants down.

And for those of you who thought it would be dirty, say two Hail Marys!

A married woman is having an affair. Whenever her lover comes over, she puts her nine year old son in the closet.

One day the woman hears a car in the driveway and puts her lover in the closet, as well.

Inside the closet, the little boy says, "It's dark in here, isn't it?"

"Yes it is," the man replies."You wanna buy a baseball?" the little boy asks."No thanks," the man replies."I think you do want to buy a baseball," the little extortionist continues."OK. How much?" the man replies after considering the position he was in."Twenty-five dollars," the little boy replies."TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?

!" the man repeats. "That's awful expensive", but because of the position he was in, agreed to the price.

The following week, the lover is visiting the woman again when she hears a car in the driveway and, again, places her lover in the closet with her little boy."It's dark in here, isn't it?" the boy starts off."Yes it is," replies the man."Wanna buy a baseball glove?" the little boy asks."OK. How much?" the hiding lover responds, acknowledging his dis-advantage."Fifty dollars," the boy replies and the transaction is completed.

The next weekend, the little boy's father says, "Hey, son. Go get your ball and glove and we'll play some catch."

"I can't. I sold them," replies the little boy."How much did you get for them?" asks the father, expecting to hear the profit in terms of lizards and candy."Seventy-five dollars," the little boy says."SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?

! That's thievery! I'm taking you to the church right now. You must confess your sin and ask for forgiveness,"the father explains as he hauls the child away.

At the church, the little boy goes into the confessional, draws the curtain, sits down, and says "It's dark in here, isn't it?"

"Don't you start that crap in here," the priest says.

A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetie for Valentine's Day.

As they had not been dating very long, it was a very difficult decision.

After careful consideration he decided a good gift would be a pair of gloves.

Accompanied by his sister, he went to the store and bought the gloves. His sister purchased a pair of panties at the same time.

The clerk carefully wrapped both items but in the process got them mixed up.

The sister was handed the gloves and the young man got the panties.

The young man mailed his Valentine's Day gift with the following note:"This special Valentines Day gift was chosen because I noticed you are in the habit of not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister, I would have chosen the ones with buttons, but she prefers short ones that are much easier to remove."These are a lovely shade, the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and they looked quite lovely.

I wish I was there to put them on you for the first time; no doubt, other hands will come into contact with them before I have a chance to see you again.

When you take them off, remember to blow on them lightly before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.

Just think how many times I'll be kissing them in the future. I hope you'll wear them Friday night for me.

Love,

Honey Bearp.

s. The sales lady says the latest style is to wear them folded down with just a little fur showing.

One day there were 10 would-be Catholic priests, going through the tests that would make them ministers. The final test required them to all strip butt-naked and standin a row with little bells attached to their ding-dongs, facing a beautiful naked woman. Well, lo and behold one of the bells went off, but when it did, it fell to the ground. As soon as its owner bent over to pick it up, all the 9 remaining bells sounded at once.

Yup. Nine more ordained priests added to the Catholic Church.

Sister Mary Holycard was in her 60s, and much admired for her sweetness and kindness to all.

One afternoon early in the spring a young priest came to chat, so she welcomed him into her Victorian parlor.

She then invited him to have a seat while she prepared a little tea.

As he sat facing her old pump organ, the young priest noticed a crystal glass bowl sitting on top of it filled with water, and in the water floated, a condom.

Well, imagine how shocked and surprised he was. Imagine his curiosity! Surely, he thought, Sister Mary had flipped or something!

When she returned with tea and cookies, they began to chat, and of course, the priest tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water, and the strange floater. Soon it got the better of him and he could resist no longer."Sister," he asked, "I wonder if you could tell me about this?" (pointing to the crystal bowl)"Oh, yes," she replied, "Isn't it wonderful?"

"I was walking downtown last fall and I found this little package. The directions said to put it on the organ, keep it wet, and it would prevent disease. And you know I haven't had a cold all winter!"

Mueller is traveling with his wife and mother-in-law in a far east country. At a place of honor his mother-in-law makes a careless remark, which the native people take as an insult to the royal family. Mueller is dragged off to court with his wife and mother-in-law and are sentenced to corporal punishment. Each of them are to recieve 50 lashes on the rear end with a cane. But because the royal family doesn't want to appear hostile to foreigners, they grant the guests in their country a wish beforehand, as long as it is able to be fulfilled. Mrs. Mueller is first. "What do you wish for yourself?" "I would like a pillow bound on my rear end before the lashings." "Okay, that shall be granted to you." Mrs. Mueller has the pillow bound to her rear end and receives her punishment. But because the pillow is too small and the executioner also hits her back a couple of times, she receives a few blows. Next it is Mueller's mother-in-law's turn. "What do you wish for yourself?" "I would like a pillow bound on my rear end and a pillow bound on my back before the lashings." "Okay, that shall be granted to you." The mother-in-law receives her fifty lashes, but hardly feels the pain through the pillows. Then comes Mueller himself. "What do you wish for yourself?" "I have two wishes. Do you want to fulfill them for me?" "Because you are a guest in our country, we want to fulfill your wishes for you, as long as they are reasonable." "I would like 100 lashes instead of 50." The executioner is surprised, but recovers again right away and replies, "Yes, that is a pious wish, it shall be granted to you. And what is your second wish?" "I would like to have my mother-in-law bound to my back."

A man was getting a haircut prior to a trip to Rome. He mentioned the trip to the barber who responded, "Rome? Why would anyone want to go there?

It's crowded & dirty and full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome.

So, how are you getting there?"

"We're taking TWA," was the reply. "We got a great rate!"

"TWA?" exclaimed the barber. "That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late.

So, where are you staying in Rome?"

"We'll be at the downtown International Marriott."

"That dump! That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?"

"We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope."

"That's rich," laughed the barber. "You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it."A month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome."It was wonderful," explained the man, "not only were we on time in one of TWA's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot.

And the hotel-it was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!"

"Well," muttered the barber, "I know you didn't get to see the pope."

"Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me."

"Really?" asked the Barber. "What'd he say?"He said, "Where'd you get the lousy haircut?

Two elderly women were out driving in a large car, both women barely large enough to see over the dashboard. As they cruised along, they came to an intersection. The stoplight was red, but they just went right on through.

The woman in the passenger seat thought to herself, "I must be losing it, I could have sworn we just went through a red light." After a few more minutes, they came to another intersection, the light was red, and again they went right through.

This time, the passenger was almost sure that the light had been red, but was also concerned that she might be seeing things. She was getting nervous, and decided to pay very close attention.

At the next intersection, sure enough, the light was definitely red, and they went right through it. She turned to the other woman and said, "Mildred! Did you know we just ran through three red lights in a row? You could have killed us!"Mildred turned to her and said, "Oh my goodness! Am I driving?"

Upon arriving home in eager anticipation of a leisurely evening, the husband was met at the door by his sobbing wife. Tearfully she explained, "It's the pharmacist - he insulted me terribly this morning on the phone."Immediately, the husband drove downtown to accuse the pharmacist and demand an apology. Before he could say more than a word or two, the pharmacist told him, "Now, just a minute - listen to my side of it. This morning the alarm failed to go off, so I was late getting up. I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, but I'll be damned if I didn't lock the house with both house and car keys inside. I had to break a window to get my keys. Driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Then, about three blocks from the store I had a flat tire. When I finally got to the store, there was a bunch of people waiting for me to open up. I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, and all the time the darn phone was ringing its head off. Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor. I got down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels - the phone is till ringing - when I came up I cracked my head on the open cash drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of perfume bottles on it, and half of them hit the floor and broke. The phone is still ringing with no let up, I finally got back to answer it."The pharmacist continues, "It was your wife - she wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer. Well, Mister, I TOLD HER!

One Day, at a bus stop there was a girl who was wearing a skintight miniskirt. When the bus arrived, and it was her turn to get on, she realized that her skirt was so tight that she couldn't get her foot high enough to reach the step. Thinking it would give her enough slack to raise her leg, she reaches back and unzipps her skirt a little. She still could not reach the step. Embarrassed, she reaches back once again to unzip it a little more. Still, she couldn't reach the step. So, with her skirt zipper halfway down, she reaches back and unzips her skirt all the way. Thinking that she could get on the step now, she lifts up her leg only to realize that she still couldn't reach the step. So, seeing how embarrased the girl was, the man standing behind her put his hands around her waist and lifted her up on to the first step of the bus. The girl turns around furiously and says, ?

How dare you touch my body that way, I don't even know you!

? Shocked, the man says, ?

Well, ma'am, after you reached around and unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we were friends.

A man was walking along a Florida beach and stumbled across an old lamp. He picked it up and rubbed it, and out popped a genie.

The genie said, "OK, You released me from the lamp, blah blah blah. This is the fourth time this month, and I'm getting a little sick of these wishes so you can forget about three.

.. You only get one wish!"The man sat, and thought about it for a while and said, "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii, but I'm scared to fly, and I get very seasick. Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to visit?"The genie laughed and said, "That's impossible!

!!

Think of the logistics of that! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete -- how much steel!

! No, think of another wish."The man said, "OK, I'll try to think of a really good wish." Finally, he said, "I've been married and divorced four times. My wives always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive.

So, I wish that I could understand women, know how they feel inside, and what they're thinking when they give me the silent treatment. Know why they're crying, know what they really want when they say "nothing,", know how to make them truly happy."The genie said, "Do you want that bridge to be two lanes or four?"

How To Give Your Cat a Pill        1.  Grasp cat firmly in your arms. Cradle its head on your elbows, just as    if you were giving a baby a bottle. Coo confidently, "That's a nice    kitty."  Drop pill into its mouth.

2.  Retrieve cat from top of lamp and pill from under sofa.

3.  Follow same procedure as in 1, but hold cat's front paws down with left    hand and back paws down with elbow of right arm. Poke pill into its    mouth with right forefinger.

4.  Retrieve cat from under bed. Get new pill from bottle. (Resist impulse    to get new cat.

)5.  Again proceed as in 1, except when you have cat firmly cradled in    bottle-feeding position, sit down on edge of chair, fold your torso    over cat, bring your right hand over your left elbow, open cat's    mouth by lifting the upper jaw and pop the pill in -- quickly. Since    your head is down by your knees, you won't be able to see what you're    doing. That's just as well.

6.  Leave cat hanging on drapes. Leave pill in your hair.

7.  If you're a woman, have a good cry. If you're a man, have a good cry.

8.  Now pull yourself together. Who's the boss here, anyway? Retrieve cat    and pill. Assuming position 1, say sternly, "Who's the boss here,    anyway?"  Open cat's mouth, take pill and .

.. Ooooops!

9.  This isn't working, is it? Collapse and think. Aha! Those flashing    claws are causing the chaos.

10. Crawl to linen closet. Drag back large beach towel. Spread towel on    floor.

11. Retrieve cat from kitchen counter and pill from potted plant.

12. Spread cat on towel near one end with its head over long edge.

13. Flatten cat's front and back legs over its stomach. (Resist impulse to    flatten cat.

)14. Roll cat in towel. Work fast; time and tabbies wait for no man -- or    woman.

15. Resume position 1. Rotate your left hand to cat's head. Press its mouth    at the jaw hinges like opening the petals of a snapdragon.

16. Drop pill into cat's mouth and poke gently. Voila! It's done.

17. Vacuum up loose fur (cat's). Apply bandages to wounds (yours).

18. Take two aspirins and lie down.

It's a beautiful warm spring day and a man and his wife are at the   zoo. She's wearing a cute, loose-fitting, pink spring dress,   sleeveless w/straps. As they walk through the ape exhibit and pass in   front of a very large gorilla, the gorilla goes ape. He jumps up on   the bars, holding on w/one hand (and 2 feet), grunting and pounding   his chest w/the free hand. He is obviously excited at the pretty lady   in the sheer dress.      The husband, noticing the excitement, suggests that his wife tease the   poor fellow. He tells her to pucker her lips, wiggle her bottom, and   flirt w/the ape.      She does and the gorilla gets even more excited, making noises that   would wake the dead. Then the husband suggests that she let one of her   straps fall; she does, and the gorilla is so excited, he's just about   to tear the bars down.      The husband then suggests that the wife lift her dress up above the   thighs.

.. this drives the gorilla absolutely crazy.      Then, quickly the husband grabs his wife by the hair, rips open the   door to the cage, slings her in w/the gorilla and says, "Now, tell him   you have a headache."

At about 2:00 in the morning, the phone rang.  "Is this the vet?" asked an elderly lady's voice."Yes, it is", replied the vet, "Is this an emergency?"

"Well, sort of", said the elderly lady, "there's a whole bunch of cats on the roof outside making a terrible noise mating and I can't get to sleep. What can I do about it?"  There was a sharp intake of breath from the vet, who then patiently replied "Open the window and tell them they're wanted on the phone"

"Really?" said the elderly lady, "Will that will that stop them?"

"Should do," said the vet, "- IT STOPPED ME!"

"That's obscene!" the priest exclaimed, "I can see why youare embarrassed." He thought a minute and then said, "You know,

I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrotswhom I have taught to pray and read the Bible.

Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them inthe cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrotsto praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop sayingthat.

that phrase in no time." "Thank you," the womanresponded, "this may very well be the solution." The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest'shouse. As he ushered her in, she saw this two male parrots wereinside their cage, hold their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them. After just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed outin unison, "Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have somefun?"There was a stunned silence. Finally, one male parrot lookedover at the other male parrot and said, "Put the beads away,

Francis, our prayers have been answered!"

The officer looked down at the monkey and said "I wish you could talk." The monkey looked up at the officer and shook his head up and down. "You can understand what I'm saying?" asked the officer. Again, the monkey shook his head up and down."Well, did you see this?"

"Yes," motioned the monkey."What happened?"The monkey pretended to have a can in his hand and turned it up by his mouth."They were drinking?" asked the officer."Yes."

"What else?"The monkey pinched his fingers together and held them to his mouth."They were smoking marijuana?"

"Yes."

"What else?"The monkey motioned "Screwing."

"They were screwing, too?" asked the astounded officer."Yes." "Now wait, you're saying your owners were drinking, smoking and screwing before they wrecked."

"Yes."

"What were you doing during all this?"

"Driving" motioned the monkey.

I can discuss politics, sports, religion, most any subject you wish."   The guy says "Gee, you sound like just what I was looking for."

There once was a baby elephant and a baby turtle drinking from a river deep in the jungle. For no reason, the turtle reaches over and bites the elephant's tail, really hard.

Years and years later, the same elephant, now grown up, is by the same river, having a drink with his giraffe buddy, when the same turtle that bit him on the tail all those years ago wanders up to the river. The elephant rears back a leg and kicks the turtle as hard as he can, sending him flying way off into the jungle."Why did you do that?" the giraffe asks."When we both were babies, that turtle bit my tail for no reason," the elephant replied."Wow! You must have a good memory!" exclaimed the giraffe."Yep!" said the elephant. "I've got Turtle-Recall."

Farmer John had just walked into the local watering hole, when who   should he see, but his   old friend Chris the tractor salesman sitting up at the bar. Chris   looked so down and   dejected, that John just had to go up and say something to him. "Say,   Chris, how ya   doing? How's the tractor selling business these days?" If Chris had   looked sad before, at   the mention of tractor sales, his face sank even more, and a tear came   to his eye.   "John," he said, shaking his head, "I don't know what it is. I can't   sell a tractor these days   to save my life. I'll tell you, I just gotta sell one tractor and   soon, or else I'll lose that   dealership for good."   "Well," John said, taking the barstool next to him, "If you think you   got it bad, I got it   worse. Now you listen to this.

Anyway, no   sooner did I sit   down on the milking stool and get to work, but ol' Bes starts a   slappin' me with her tail.   After a minute or so, I got fed up with it, so I threw a rope up over   the rafters, and tied ol'   Bessy's tail to the rafters. Then I got back to work." "I didn't even   get two squirts into the   bucket, when Bes gives me a kick. Knocked me clean off the stool! Boy,   did that upset   me! So I get me another rope an' tie Bessy's right hind leg to the   side of the milking stall,   and get a started trying to milk her again." "Well by this time,   Bessy's about livid, and she   doesn't want any part of it, so she let's me have it with her other   hind leg. I wasn't about   to give in to this ol' cow, so I got me yet another piece of rope and   tied up Bessy's left leg   to the other side of the stall." Just then John paused to take a sip   his beer.   Chris, distracted for a moment from his own troubles, asked John,   "Well, did you finally   get to milk her?" "Well, yes and no, Chris. But I'll tell ya what.

..   If you can convince my   wife that I was out there to MILK that cow, I'll BUY a tractor from   ya.

Laboratory Rabbit Freedom   A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where he   had been born and   brought up. As he scurried away from the fencing of the compound, he   felt grass under his   little feet and saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life.   'Wow, this is great,

' he   thought. It wasn't long before he came to a hedge and, after squeezing   under it he saw a   wonderful sight lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at   the lush grass.   'Hey,

' he called. 'I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've just   escaped. Are you wild   rabbits?   'Yes. Come and join us,

' they cried.   Our friend hopped over to them and started eating the grass. It tasted   so good. 'What else   do you wild rabbits do?

' he asked.   'Well,

' one of them said. 'You see that field there? It's got carrots   growing in it. We dig   them up and eat them.

'   This, he couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most   succulent carrots. They   were wonderful.   Later, he asked them again, 'What else do you do?

'   'You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We eat them   as well.

'   The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned a while later   completely full. 'Is there   anything else you guys do?

' he asked.   One of the other rabbits came a bit closer to him and spoke softly.   'There's one other thing   you must try. You see those rabbits there,

' he said, pointing to the   far corner of the field.   'They're girls. We poke them. Go and try it.

'   Well, our friend spent the rest of the morning screwing his little   heart out until, completely   knackered, he staggered back over to the guys.   'That was fantastic,

' he panted.   'So are you going to live with us then?

' one of them asked.   'I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.

'   The wild rabbits all stared at him, a bit surprised. 'Why? We thought   you liked it here.

'   'I do,

' our friend replied. 'But I must get back to the laboratory.   I'm dying for a cigarette.

Want some chicken?   A man was driving along a freeway when he noticed a chicken running   along side his car. He was amazed to see the chicken keeping up with   him because he was doing 50 MPH.

A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse   falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go   and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to   the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's   Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He   then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and   drives the car forward saving him from sinking!   A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow   again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to   the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, "I   think I can stand over the hole!" So he stretched over the width of   the hole and said, "Grab for my 'thingy' and pull yourself up." And   the chicken did and pulled himself to safety.   The moral of the story:   If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up   chicks.

As you may know, the Albuquerque housing market is becoming   as tight as the one in Denver. My friend Chuck, after searching for   months, found the perfect place. Family neighborhood, garden/lawn,   etc. The problem was, he has a dog, and the landlord specified "No   dogs." Rather than go on searching, he decided to go stealth, and not   tell the landlord about his dog (a golden retriever).

All went well for   months. Except for one thing: the family that lived downstairs had a   rabbit that they kept in a cage in the garden area. One day, the   father of the family walked into the garden to find the dog scratching   at the cage, trying to get at the rabbit.   He immediately went to the landlord and complained. The landlord   threatened to kick Chuck out. But Chuck, being quite persuasive- and   punctual with rent checks- convinced the landlord to keep him and his   dog. On the condition that that Chuck keep his dog out of the garden   area. Months went by with no incidence. However, his girlfriend stayed   home sick at his place one day. She, not knowing the garden rule, let   the dog out.   Chuck came home and, to his dismay, found that the dog wasn't in the   house. He opened the back door, and there at the steps was his dog.   Dead rabbit in mouth. Needless to say, Chuck panicked. Not wanting to   face certain eviction(and possible jail time), he took matters into   his own hands. He bathed the dead rabbit, blow-dried its hair (OK he   was desperate) and carefully placed the rabbit back in the cage.   Natural causes, right? Nothing happened.   After an excruciating week, he finally approached his neighbor one   morning on the way to work. "How is everything?" asked Chuck. "We're   moving" replied the man. "This is a sick neighborhood." "Why? What   happened?" replied Chuck. The neighbor replied: "Some sick bastard dug   up our recently deceased rabbit, washed it, combed its hair, and put   it back in its cage."

just let me have the two old hens   over in the corner. I won't bother you."   The young rooster says, "Scram! Beat it! You're washed up! I'm taking   over!"

Whoever wins the race gets domain of the chicken   coop."   The young rooster says, "You know I'm going to beat you, old man, just   to be fair, I'm even going to give you a head start."   They line up in back of the farm house, get a chicken to cluck "Go!"   and the old rooster takes off running.   About 15 seconds later the young rooster takes off after him.   They round the front of the farm house and the young rooster is only   about 5 inches behind the old rooster and gaining fast.

A man in a state of excessive inebriation rolled up at a fairground rifle range booth and threw down the necessary money. The booth operator at first refused to let him have a turn, considering that his inebriated state would endanger the public. But the drunk insisted and was given a gun.

He aimed unsteadily in the general direction of the target and after tying to focus, pulled the trigger three times. The booth owner, on inspecting the target, was astonished to see that he had scored three bullseyes. The star prize for the evening was a large set of glassware, but the showman was certain that the drunk wasn't aware of what he had done, and gave him instead a consolation prize, a small, live turtle. The drunk wandered off into the crowd.

An hour or so later he came back, even more drunk than before. Once again the showman demurred, but once again the drunk insisted, and once more scored three bullseyes and was given another turtle.

Eventually the drunk rolled up again and insisted on a third attempt. Once more he picked up the rifle, waved it around in the general direction of the target, and pulled the trigger three times. Once more he had scored three bullseyes. But this time there was an onlooker with good eyesight."That's fantastic", the man said. "Hasn't he scored three bulls?"The showman, cursing his luck, made a show of going over to the target and inspecting it closely."Yes, sir!", he announced to the crowd. "This is fantastic! Congratulations, sir, you have won the star prize, this magnificent 68-piece set of glassware!"

"I don't want any bloody glasses", the drunk replied. "Give me another one of those little crusty meat pies!"

"What's the difference between the North American porcupine and the African porcupine," the society matron asked the zookeeper."The principal difference is the North American species has a longer prick."This, as you might assume, distressed the matron who stormed immediately to the zoo manager's office. The zoo manager said, "Ma'am, I apologize for my staff's unfortunate choice of terms. What the keeper should have said is the North American species has a longer *quill*. In fact, their pricks are just about the same size."

Then he deleted the word and added another, so that the sentence now read: "I would like to place an order for two mongeese, to be delivered at your earliest convenience."Again he stared at the screen, this time focusing on the new word, which seemed just as odd as the original one. Finally, he deleted the whole sentence and started all over. "Everyone knows no full-stocked zoo should be without a mongoose," he typed. "Please send us two of them."

netI like monkeys. The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece. Ithought that odd since they were normally a couple thousand. I decided notto look a gift horse in the mouth. I bought 200. I like monkeys.

I took my 200 monkeys home. I have a big car. I let one drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept  punching themselves in their genitals. I laughed. Then they punched my genitals.  I stopped laughing.

I herded them into my room. They didn't adapt very well to their newenvironment. They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at highspeeds and slam into the wall. Although humorous at first, the spectaclelost its novelty halfway into its third hour.

Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive, theyall died. No apparent reason. They all just sorta' dropped dead. Kinda' like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later. Damn cheap monkeys.  I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room, on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked like I had 200 throw rugs.

I tried to flush one down the toilet. It didn't work. It got stuck. Then Ihad one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys.

I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals. That worked for awhile, that is until they began to decompose. It started to smell real bad.

I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want to call the plumber. I was embarrassed.

I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them. Unfortunately,

there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time so I had to change them every  30 seconds. I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't all  go bad.

I tried burning them. Little did I know my bed was flammable. I had toextinguish the fire.

Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed. The odor wasn't improving.

I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys and to use thebathroom. I severely beat one of my monkeys. I felt better.

I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said that the city was notallowed to dispose of charred primates. I told him that I had a wet one. He couldn't take that one either. I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.

I finally arrived at a solution. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. Myfriends didn't know quite what to say. They pretended that they like them,

but I could tell they were lying. Ingrates. So I punched them in thegenitals.

I like monkeys.

To her surprise, the dog answers "My name's Huey and I'm having a great day going in and out of puddles." She goes up to the second dog and asks "What's your name?"

A young boy, about eight years old, walks into the localgrocery store and picks our a huge box of laundry detergent.

The grocer walked over, and trying to be friendly,

asked the boy if he had a lot of laundry to do."Nope, no laundry," the boy said, "I'm going to wash my dog!"

"But you shouldn't use this to wash your dog. It's verypowerful and if you wash your dog in this, he'll get sick.

In fact, it might even kill him."But the boy was not to be stopped and carried the detergentto the counter and paid for it, even as the grocer stilltried to talk him out of washing his dog.

About a week later the boy was back in the store to buy somecandy. The grocer asked the boy how his dog was doing."Oh, he died," the boy said sadly.

The grocer, trying not to be an I-told-you-so, said he wassorry the dog died but added, "I tried to tell you not to usethat detergent on your dog!"

Cats are independent, they don't listen,

A man wrote a letter to a small hotel in a midwest town he planned to visit on his vacation.

He wrote, "I would very much like to bring my dog with me. He is well groomed and very well behaved. Would you be willing to permit me to keep him in my room with me at night?"An immediate reply came from the hotel owner, who said, "I've been operating this hotel for many years. In all that time, I've never had a dog steal towels, bedclothes, silverware or pictures off the walls. I've never had to evict a dog in the middle of the night for being drunk and disorderly. and I've never had a dog run out on a hotel bill. Yes, indeed, your dog is welcome at my hotel. And, if your dog will vouch for you, you're welcome to stay here, too."

A Second OpinionA man runs into the vet's office carrying his dog, screaming forhelp. The vet rushes him back to an examination room and has himput his dog down on the examination table.  The vet examines thestill, limp body and after a few moments tells the man that hisdog, regrettably, is dead. The man, clearly agitated and notwilling to accept this, demands a second opinion.

The vet goes into the back room and comes out with a cat and putsthe cat down next to the dog's body. The cat sniffs the body,

walks from head to tail poking and sniffing the dog's body andfinally looks at the vet and meows. The vet looks at the man andsays, "I'm sorry, but the cat thinks that your dog is dead too."The man is still unwilling to accept that his dog is dead.

The vet brings in a black Labrador. The lab sniffs the body,

walks from head to tail, and finally looks at the vet and barks.

The vet looks at the man and says, "I'm sorry, but the lab thinksyour dog is dead too."The man, finally resigned to the diagnosis, thanks the vet andasks how much he owes. The vet answers, "$650."

"$650 to tell me my dog is dead?" exclaimed the man.

."Well," the vet replies, "I would only have charged you $50 formy initial diagnosis. The additional $600 was for the cat scanand lab tests."

This is what should happen to ALL CATS.

.!

HOW TO WASH THE CAT1. Thoroughly clean the toilet.

2. Add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet water and have both lids up.

3. Find the cat and soothe him while you carry him toward the bathroom.

4. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close both lids. (You may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot escape.

) The cat will self-agitate and make ample suds.  Never mind the noises that come from your toilet, the cat is actually enjoying this.

CAUTION:Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge, as his claws will be reaching out for anything they can find.

5. Flush the toilet three or four times.  This provides a Power "Wash" and "Rinse", which I have found to be quite effective.

6. Have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the outside door.

7. Stand behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift both lids.

8. The now-clean cat will rocket out of the toilet, and run outside where he will dry himself.

Sincerely,

THE DOG

In the dead of summer a fly was resting on a leaf beside a lake. He was ahot, dry fly who said to no one in particular, "Gosh! If I go down threeinches I will feel the mist from the water and I will be refreshed."There was a fish in the water thinking, "Gosh! If that fly goes down threeinches I can eat him."There was a bear on the shore thinking, "Gosh! If that fly goes down threeinches.

.. that fish will jump for the fly.

.. and I will eat him."It also happened that a hunter was further up the bank of the lake,

preparing to eat a cheese sandwich. "Gosh!" he thought, "If that fly goesdown three inches.

.. and that fish leaps for it.

.. that bear will exposehimself and grab for the fish. I'll shoot the bear and then have a properlunch."You probably think this is enough activity for one bank of a lake, but Ican tell you there was more.

A wee mouse by the hunter's foot was thinking, "Gosh! If that fly goes downthree inches.

.. and that fish jumps for that fly .

..

and that bear grabs forthat fish.

.. the dumb hunter will shoot the bear and drop his cheese sandwich."A cat, lurking in the bushes took in this scene and thought, as wasfashionable to do on the banks of this particular lake around lunchtime,"Gosh.

.. if that fly goes down three inches.

..

and that fish jumps for thatfly.

.. and that bear grabs for that fish .

..

and that hunter shoots thatbear.

.. and that mouse makes off with the cheese sandwich.

.. then I can have mouse for lunch."The poor fly is finally so hot and so dry that he heads down for thecooling mist of the water.

.. The fish swallows the fly.

.. The mouse grabs the cheesesandwich.

.. The cat jumps for the mouse.

Why I Fired My Secretary I woke up early, feeling depressed because it was my birthday, and I thought,"I'm another year older," but decided to make the best of it. So I showered andshaved, knowing when I went down to breakfast my wife would greet me with a bigkiss and say, "Happy birthday, dear." All smiles, I went in to breakfast, andthere sat my wife, reading her newspaper, as usual. She didn't say one word. SoI got myself a cup of coffee, made some toast and thought to myself, "Oh well,

she forgot. The kids will be down in a few minutes, smiling and happy, and theywill sing 'Happy Birthday' and have a nice gift for me." There I sat, enjoyingmy coffee, and I waited. Finally, the kids came running into the kitchen,

yelling, "Give me a slice of toast! I'm late! Where is my coat? I'm going tomiss the bus!" Feeling more depressed than ever, I left for the office. When I walked into the office, my secretary greeted me with a great big smileand a cheerful "Happy birthday, boss." She then asked if she could get me somecoffee. Her remembering my birthday made me feel a whole lot better. Later in the morning, my secretary knocked on my office door and said, "Sinceit's your birthday, why don't we have lunch together?" Thinking it would makeme feel better, I said, "That's a good idea." So we locked up the office, andsince it was my birthday, I said, "Why don't we drive out of town and havelunch in the country instead of going to the usual place?" So we drove out oftown and went to a little out-of-the-way inn and had a couple of martinis and anice lunch. We started driving back to town, when my secretary said, "Why don'twe go to my place, and I will fix you another martini." It sounded like a goodidea, since we didn't have much to do in the office. So we went to herapartment, and she fixed us some martinis. After a while, she said, "If youwill excuse me, I think I will slip into something more comfortable," and sheleft the room. In a few minutes, she opened her bedroom door and came out carrying a bigbirthday cake. Following her were my wife and all my kids. And there I sat withnothing on but my socks.

God Meets BureaucracyIn the beginning God Created heaven and the earth. Quickly he was facedwith a class action suit for failure to file an environmental impactstatement.  He was granted a temporary permit for the project, but wasstymied with the Cease and Desist order for the earthly part.  Appearing atthe hearing, God was asked why he began his earthly project in the firstplace.  He replied that he just liked to be creative.

Then God said, "Let there be light." Officials immediately demanded toknow how the light would be made. Would there be strip mining? What aboutthermal pollution? God explained that the light would come from a huge ballof fire.  God was granted provisional permission to make light, assumingthat no smoke would result from the ball of fire, that he would obtain abuilding permit, and (to conserve energy) would have the light out half thetime.  God agreed and said he would call the light "Day" and the darkness"Night." Officials replied that they were not interested in semantics.

God said, "Let the earth bring forth green herb and such as manyseed."The EPA agreed so long as native seed was used. Then God said, "Let watersbring forth creeping creatures having life; and the fowl that may fly overthe earth." Officials pointed out this would require approval from theDepartment of Game coordinated with the Heavenly Wildlife Federation andthe Audubongelic Society.

Everything was OK until God said he wanted to complete the project in sixdays. Officials informed him it would take at least 200 days to review theapplication and the environmental impact statement. After that there would be a public hearing. Then there would be 10-12 months before.

..

At this point God created Hell.

They parked their truck the end of the alley and worked their way to the other end. At the last house a woman looking out her kitchen window watched the two men as they checked her gas meter.

Finishing the meter check, the senior supervisor challenged his younger coworker to a foot race down the alley back to the truck to prove that an older guy could outrun a younger one.

As they came running up to the truck, they realized the lady from that last house was huffing and puffing right behind them. They stopped and asked her what was wrong.

Gasping for breath, she replied, "When I see two gas men running as hard as you two were, I figured I'd better run too!"

So my sister, a natural blond graduating from the University of North Carolina Law School, is job hunting. I suggested that since Microsoft is building up their legal team, she should send them a resume and become a southern blond Microsoft lawyer -- and be the butt of any joke on the internet.

A man was being interviewed for a job. "Were you in the service?" ask the interviewer. "Yes, I was a marine," responded the applicant. "Did you see any active duty?" "I was in Vietnam for 2 years and I have a partial disability." "May I ask what happened?" "Well, I had a grenade go off between my legs and I lost both testicles." "You're hired. You can start Monday at 10 am." "When does everyone else start? I don't want any preferential treatment because of my disability." "Everyone else starts at 7 am but I might as well be honest with you. Nothing gets done between 7 and 10. We just sit around scratching our balls trying to decide what to do first."

Retire Aged Personell EarlyTO      ALL MCCCD EMPLOYEESFROM    GOVERNING BOREDDATE    22 APR 19861.      As a result of the HAYZE mismanagement study, we mustdrastically cut most salaries and reduce our number of personnel.

Under this plan, older employees will go on early retirement,

thus permitting management to focus its abuse on youngeremployees who represent our future.

2.      Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by theend of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placedinto effect immediately. The program will be known as RAPE(Retire Aged Personnel Early). Employees who are RAPED will begiven the opportunity to work other jobs within the system atgreatly reduced pay. This phase of the reduction program iscalled SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers).

3.      All employees who have been RAPED or SCREWED may applyfor a new re- employment eligibility service. This service willbe called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority FollowingTermination). Current regulations state that employees may onlybe RAPED once and SCREWED twice, but they may get the SHAFT asmany times as management deems appropriate.

4.      If an employee meets all of the above requirements,

he/she will be entitled to get HERPES (Half Earnings of RetiredPersons Entitlement System). HERPES is considered as a bonus plansince the employee can no longer be RAPED and SCREWED bymanagement. RAPED personnel may also get Assistance for ImmediateDisplacement Service (AIDS). Since AIDS has serious implications,

one should only request this service once.

5.      Employees can enhance their retention prospects bysigning up for additional training. It is now and always has beenthe policy of management to ensure all employees are well trainedthrough our Special High Intensity Training (SHIT). We have givenour employees more SHIT than any other organization in thecountry. If any employee feels he/she does not receive enoughSHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor. Our management isespecially trained to ensure that you will get all the SHIT youcan stand.

6.      To ensure equal treatment of all MCCCD employees, onlyupper-management and their selected brown-noses will be givenraises and exempt status from the above programs.             Yu Bien Haad             MCCCD GOVERNING BOREDP.

S.    We in upper management would like to once again applaudthe HAYZE people for their very consistent and reasonable study;heck, we couldn't have paid anyone to make up a better report!

How Shit HappensIn the Beginning was The PlanAnd then came the AssumptionsAnd the Assumptions were without formAnd the Plan was completely without substanceAnd the darkness was upon the face of the WorkersAnd the Workers spoke amongst themselves, saying"It is a crock of shit, and it stinketh."And the Workers went unto their Supervisors and sayeth,"It is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor thereof."And the Supervisors went unto their Managers and sayeth unto them,"It is a container of excrement and it is very strong,     such that none may abide by it."And the Managers went unto their Directors and sayeth,"It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength."And the Directors spoke among themselves, saying one to another,"It contains that which aids plant growth, and it is very strong."And the Directors went unto the Vice Presidents and sayeth unto them,"It promotes growth and is very powerful."And the Vice Presidents went unto the President and sayeth unto him,"This new Plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency of this     Company, and in these Areas in particular."And the President looked upon The Plan,

And saw that it was good, and The Plan became Policy.

And this is how Shit Happens.

The contemplative routine of the convent was being disrupted by the presence of workmen converting the electrical service from overhead lines to buried cable. Mother Superior called the electric company's complaint department to ask for help."The profanity these men use constantly is unsuitable for our community. You must make them stop cursing so much.", said the nun."Very well, sister. But you must make allowances for their habits. Even when they are trying to be tactful, they will still tend to call a spade a spade.", said the company spokeswoman.

Mother superior then observed, "I think the term they actually use is 'fucking shovel'".

Are you kidding?"And the interviewer replied, "Yeah, but you started it."

Why you should learn to use algebra . . . After applying some simple algebra to some trite phrases and cliches a new understanding can bereached of the secret to wealth and success.

Here it goes.     Knowledge is Power     Time is Money and as every engineer knows,     Power is Work over Time.

So, substituting algebraic equations for these time worn bits of wisdom, we get:     K = P (1)     T = M (2)     P = W/T (3)Now, do a few simple substitutions:     Put W/T in for P in equation (1), which yields:     K = W/T (4)Put M in for T into equation (4), which yields:     K = W/M (5).

Now we've got something. Expanding back into English, we get:     Knowledge equals Work over Money.

What this MEANS is that:     1. The More You Know, the More Work You Do, and     2. The More You Know, the Less Money You Make.

Solving for Money, we get:     M = W/K (6)     Money equals Work Over Knowledge.

From equation (6) we see that Money approaches infinity as Knowledge approaches 0, regardlessof the Work done.

What THIS MEANS is:     The More you Make, the Less you Know.

Solving for Work, we get     W = M K (7)     Work equals Money times KnowledgeFrom equation (7) we see that Work approaches 0 as Knowledge approaches 0.

What THIS MEANS is:     The stupid rich do little or no work.

Working out the socioeconomic implications of this breakthrough is left as an exercise for thereader.

Calling in Sick.

..

.   A Cat Owner's Story Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable   because no matter how legitimate my illness, I always sense my boss   thinks I am lying. On one occasion, I had a valid reason but lied   anyway because the truth was too humiliating to reveal. I simply   mentioned that I had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel   up to coming in the next day. By then, I could think up a doozy to   explain the bandage on my crown. In this case, the truth hurt. I mean   it really hurt in the place men feel the most pain. The accident   occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute   little kitty. As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower   after breakfast when I heard my wife call out to me from the kitchen.   "Ed!" she hearkened. "The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it."   "You know where the button is." I protested through the shower   (pitter-patter). "Reset it yourself!" "I am scared!" She pleaded.   "What if it starts going and sucks me in?" Pause. "C'mon, it'll only   take a second." No logical assurance about how a disposal can't start   itself will calm the fears of a person who suffers from   "Big-ol-scary-machinephobia," a condition brought on by watching too   many Stephen King movies. It is futile to argue or explain, kind of   like Lloyd Bentsen telling Americans they are over-taxed. And if a   poltergeist did, in fact, possess the disposal, and she was ground   into round, I'd have to live with that the rest of my life. So out I   came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make a statement about   how her cowardly behavior was not without consequence but it was I who   would suffer. I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find   the button. It is the last action I remember performing. It struck   without warning. Nay, it wasn't a hexed disposal drawing me into its   gnashing metal teeth. It was our new kitty, clawing playfully at the   dangling objects she spied between my legs. She ("Buttons" aka "the   Grater") had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took   the bait under the sink. At precisely the second I was most   vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged   them with her needle-like claws. Now when men feel pain or even sense   danger anywhere close to their masculine region, they lose all   rational thought to control orderly bodily movements. Instinctively,   their nerves compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising   upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a well-trained monk   could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a   kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure. Wild   animals are sometimes faced with a "fight or flight" syndrome; men, in   this predicament, choose only the "flight" option. Fleeing straight   up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is alarmed. It was a   dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great heights to escape, I never   made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the   impact knocked me out cold. When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics   stood over me. Having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics   snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing their   hysterical laughter. My wife told me I should be flattered. At the   office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me. I kept   silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. "What's the matter, cat   got your tongue?" If they had only known.

Young man Murphy applied for an engineering position at an Irish firm based in Dublin. An American applied for the same job and both applicants having the same qualifications were asked to take a test by the Department manager. Upon completion of the test both men only missed one of the questions. The manager went to Murphy and said, "Thank you for your interest, but we've decided to give the American the job."Murphy: "And why would you be doing that? We both got 9 questions correct. This being Ireland and me being Irish I should get the job!"Manager: "We have made our decision not on the correct answers, but on the question you missed."Murphy: "And just how would one incorrect answer be better than the other?"Manager: "Simple. The American put down on question # 5, 'I don't know.

' You put down 'Neither do I.

A fellow had just been hired as the new CEO of a large high tech corporation.  The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes. "Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve," he said. Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and he was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wits's end, he remembered the envelopes.  He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope.  The message read, "Blame your predecessor." The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO.  Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street -- responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him. About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope.  The message read, "Reorganize."  This he did, and the company quickly rebounded. After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times.  The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope. The message said, "Prepare three envelopes."

NOTIFICATION TO ALL STAFF REGARDING LANGUAGEIt has been brought to our attention that some individuals have beenusing foul language during the execution of their duties. Due tocomplaints from managers who are more easily offended, this type oflanguage will no longer be tolerated.

We do realise, however, the importance of staff being able to properlyexpress their feelings when communicating with other employees. Withthis in mind, the Human Resources Department has compiled a list ofcode phrases so proper exchange of ideas/information can continue inan effective manner without risking offence to our more sensitivebrethren.

Old Phrase                              New Phrase1.  No fucking way                    I'm fairly sure that this is not feasible2.  Your fucking joking               Really3.  Tell someone who gives a fuck     Have you run that by.

The strong young man at the construction site was bragging that he could outdo anyone in a feat of strength. He made a special case of making fun of one of the older workmen. After several minutes, the older worker had had enough."Why don't you put your money where your mouth is," he said. "I will bet a week's wages that I can haul something in a wheelbarrow over to that outbuilding that you won't be able to wheel back."

"You're on, old man," the braggart replied. "Let's see what you got."The old man reached out and grabbed the wheelbarrow by the handles. Then, nodding to the young man, he said, "All right. Get in."

"The popping sound isthe needle poking a hole in the end of the nipple."Later, the tour reaches the part of the factory where condoms aremanufactured. The machine makes a "Hiss. Hiss. Hiss. Hiss-pop" noise. "Waita minute!" says the man taking the tour. "I understand what the 'hiss,

hiss,

' is, but what's that 'pop' every so often?"

"Oh, it's just the same as in the baby-bottle nipple machine," says theguide. "It pokes a hole in every fourth condom."

"Well, that can't be good for the condoms!"

"Yeah, but it's great for the baby-bottle nipple business!"

The external organs of a body were fighting over who should be boss.

The brain said, "I should be boss, since I control what the person thinks." The hands said, "I should be boss because I do almost everything for the person."The legs declared, "I shuld be boss since I carry the body and all the weight is on me."So they went on, each stating their qualities and uses.

Then the Asshole spoke up, "I think I should be boss, because.

."He had not finished when everyone else started laughing at him. "You, an asshole, be the boss? You gotta be kidding!"The asshole was very unhappy, and he closed himself up.

The body soon suffered a terrible constipation, and the organs could not take it anymore. "Ok, ok, you're the boss!" they gavein. So the asshole became the boss of the body.

The moral of the story: You don't need brains to be a boss, you just need to be an asshole.

The Perverse Guide To Getting HiredChapter 1 - The Resume     Your resume is a crucial document that summarises theessence of your being to a potential employer.  You must graba personnel director's attention with your sheer, overpoweringwonderfulness, or your vitae will wind up lining the bottom ofher parakeet's cage.  Write a boring resume and you might as wellrun down now and join the other unemployed grads behind theappliance store, fighting for the choicest refrigerator carton tolive in.     To grab an employer's jaded eye you must create the writtenequivalent of a banshee wail!  Print your resume on hunter'sorange paper, so it nearly leaps out of the stack.  Experimentwith striking fonts, and use as many as possible.  Writing yourname in 2 inch high 3-D Western style letters at the top says"Check ME out! I'm no shrinking violet!"  Sprinkle a bit of yourmost sensual cologne on the sheet, and ladies, be sure to add agood lipstick smooch mark at the bottom.  Don't forget yourpicture, too!  Be sure and staple several of your best 8x10glossies from Glamour Shots on top.     Now that you've achieved that visceral "oomph", it's time topolish the contents to bring out or even invent your positivequalities.  Remember, a skilled wordsmith can transform anyqualification or attribute, no matter how trifling, into asaleable skill.  Let's look at some examples of putting the best"spin" on a job seeker's skills:"I flipped burgers for three weeks at Lardee's."     A mere burger flipper?  Why sell yourself so short?

Describe yourself as a "Grill Co-ordinator", or perhaps a"Culinary Technician"."I subbed in for my nephew's paper route one weekend."     Ah!  So you were previously employed in "CommunicationServices!"  Describe yourself as a "Journalism Representative."

"I spent the last five years sitting on a couch eating Cheetosand watching Charlie's Angels reruns."     You can transform the pathetic into the energetic byreferring to yourself as a "Consumer Broadcasting Specialist."Let them know how much time you've wisely invested in "PopularDrama Studies."

"I worked in telemarketing."     Die you scumbag."I like to drink 3 or 4 bottles of Night Train wine and pass outin a puddle of my own urine."     I see!  An "Alternative Hygiene Researcher" who throwshimself into his work!     Always remember to use active, "can-do" language in yourresume, and be sure to include as many of the following terms aspossible:     1) Excellence (can't get enough of this one!

)     2) Goal-oriented     3) Forward-thinking     4) Like Working with People (as opposed to zoo animals)     5) Striving (everyone likes a striver!

)It may be useful to define these as keyboard macros immediately.

Chapter 2 - The Interview     So now you've got that big chance to shine in person.  Onceagain, you've got to stand out from the crowd!  First, consideryour apparel carefully.  Gold lame harem pants will leave alasting impression, as will a nice fish or penis tie, availablein classier novelty stores.  Make these items staples of yourprofessional wardrobe.  Next, practice that handshake, andconsider adding a little thumb twist manoeuvre or a good high-five.  And remember, no one likes shaking dry, chapped hands, somake sure yours are damp when you leave the restroom.  Now jumpright in, and distinguish yourself with your first words.  Here'ssome suggestions for opening lines:"The voices told me I'm perfect for this job."

"I can make an impressive incendiary device from just your tie,

that pen, and a quart of anti-freeze."

"Maybe you can't tell, but I'm not wearing any underwear."

"Let's make this fast, I'm late for my medication."

"The foil wrapped around my head is to block out invisible rays."

"I was once abducted by a UFO, and the aliens let me pilot theirStarship."

"I brought my invisible friend, is that okay?"

"I have the gift of second sight, and if you step on Flight 109,

it will be your last!"     Now that you've made a big impression, make sure you'll haveplenty of time to expound upon your finer qualities.  Considerhandcuffing yourself to the interviewer's desk, or perhaps smearsuper-glue on your hand and grab them while shouting "Wonder twinpowers, activate!"     Conclude the interview as notably as you began it.  Agratuity is always welcome, so palm the interviewer a crisp newdollar in the closing handshake while saying "Guess Mr.

Washington and I have this job wrapped up, huh? (wink, wink)"And certainly don't forget the follow-up!  Unless a restrainingorder has been obtained by the employer, call collect every hourthereafter to remind them of your sincerity.

Jones came into the office an hour late for the third time in one week and found the boss waiting for him.  "What's the story this time, Jones?" he asked sarcastically.  "Let's hear a good excuse for a change."Jones sighed, "Everything went wrong this morning, Boss.  The wife decided to drive me to the station. She got ready in ten minutes, but then the drawbridge got stuck. Rather than let you down, I swam across the river (look, my suit's still damp), ran out to the airport, got a ride on Mr. Thompson's helicopter, landed on top of Radio City Music Hall, and was carried here piggyback by one of the Rockettes."

"You'll have to do better than that, Jones," said the boss, obviously disappointed.  "No woman can get ready in ten minutes."

George Costanza's Tips for Working Hard INever walk down the hall without a document in yourhands. People with documents in their hands look likehardworking employees heading for important meetings. Peoplewith nothing in their hands look like they're heading for thecafeteria. People with a newspaper in their hand look likethey're heading for the toilet. Above all, make sure youcarry loads of stuff home with you at night, thus generatingthe false impression that you work longer hours than you do.
####
Use computers to look busy. Any time you use a computer,

it looks like "work" to the casual observer. You can send andreceive personal e-mail, calculate your finances andgenerally have a blast without doing anything remotelyrelated to work. These aren't exactly the societal benefitsthat the proponents of the computer revolution would like totalk about but they're not bad either. When you get caught byyour boss -and you *will* get caught - your best defence isto claim you're teaching yourself to use new software, thussaving valuable training dollars.
####
Messy desk. Top management can get away with a cleandesk. For the rest of us, it looks like you're not workinghard enough. Build huge piles of documents around yourworkspace. To the observer, last year's work looks the sameas today's work; it's volume that counts. Pile them high andwide. If you know somebody is coming to your cubicle, burythe document you'll need halfway down in an existing stackand rummage for it when he/she arrives.
####
Voice Mail. Never answer your phone if you have voicemail. People don't call you just because they want to giveyou something for nothing - they call because they want YOUto do work for THEM. That's no way to live. Screen all yourcalls through voice mail. If somebody leaves a voice mailmessage for you and it sounds like impending work, respondduring lunch hour when you know they're not there - it lookslike you're hardworking and conscientious even though you'rebeing a devious weasel. If you diligently employ the methodof screening incoming calls and then returning calls whennobody is there, this will greatly increase the odds that thecaller will give up or look for a solution that doesn'tinvolve you. The sweetest voice mail message you can everhear is: "Ignore my last message. I took care of it". If yourvoice mailbox has a limit on the number of messages it canhold, make sure you reach that limit frequently. One way todo that is to never erase any incoming messages. If thattakes too long, send yourself a few messages. Your callerswill hear a recorded message that says, "Sorry, this mailboxis full" - a sure sign that you are a hardworking employee inhigh demand.
####
Looking Impatient and Annoyed. According to GeorgeCostanza, one should also always try to look impatientand annoyed to give your bosses the impression thatyou are always busy.
####
Appear to Work Late. Always leave the office late,

especially when the boss is still around. You could readmagazines and storybooks that you always wanted to read buthave no time until late before leaving. Make sure you walkpast the boss' room on your way out. Send important emailsat unearthly hours (e.

g. 9:35pm, 7:05am, etc.

..

) and duringpublic holidays.
####
Creative Sighing for Effect. Sigh loudly when there aremany people around, giving the impression that you arevery hard pressed.
####
Stacking Strategy. It is not enough to pile lots ofdocuments on the table. Put lots of books on the floor etc. .

Can always borrow from library. Thick computer manuals are the best.
####
Build Vocabulary. Read up on some computer magazines andpick out all the jargon and new products. Use it freely whenin conversation with bosses. Remember: They don't have tounderstand what you say, but you sure sound impressive.
####
MOST IMPORTANTLY: DON'T forward any of this to your boss by mistake!

Then he called for the second man, "Jim Johnson!" Up stepped aburley young man who seemed quite sure of himself."He looks like he cantake care of any situation," thought the manager,

and decided, there and then,

to hire him. He turned to the firstapplicant and told him he could go and they would let him know.

Turning to Johnson, he said, "Now Jim, I like the way you carryyourself -- that's an important asset for the job as cashier.

However,

you must be precise. I noticed you did not fill out theplace on the application where we asked your formal education."Jim looked a little confused so the manager said,"Where did you get your financial education?"

"Oh," replied Jim -- "Yale."

"That's very good .

No-host bar, but plenty of eggnog! We'll have a small bandplaying traditional carols.

..

feel free to sing along. And, don't besurprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus! A Christmas treewill be lit at 1:00 P.

M. Exchange of gifts among employees can be done atthat time, however, no gift should be over $10.

00 to make the giving ofgifts easy for everyone's pockets. This gathering is only for employees! Aspecial announcement will be made by our CEO at that time!

Merry Christmas to you and your family,

Patty============================================FROM: Patty Lewis, Human Resources DirectorTO: All EmployeesDATE: December 2RE: Holiday PartyIn no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees.

We recognize that Chanukah is an important holiday which often coincideswith Christmas, though unfortunately not this year. However, from now onwe're calling it our "Holiday Party." The same policy applies to employeeswho are celebrating Kwanzaa at this time. There will be no Christmas treepresent. No, Christmas carols sung. We will have other type of music foryour enjoyment. Happy now?

Happy Holidays to you and your family,

Patty============================================FROM: Patty Lewis, Human Resources DirectorTO: All EmployeesDATE: December 3RE: Holiday PartyRegarding the note I received from a member of Alcoholics Anonymousrequesting a non-drinking table .

.. You didn't sign your name. I'm happyto accommodate this request, but if I put a sign on a table that reads,"AA Only"; you wouldn't be anonymous anymore. How am I supposed to handlethis? Somebody? Forget about the gifts exchange, no gifts exchange areallowed since the union members feel that $10.

00 is too much money andexecutives believe $10.

00 is very little for a gift.

NO GIFT EXCHANGE WILL BE ALLOWED.

============================================FROM: Patty Lewis, Human Resources DirectorTO: All EmployeesDATE: December 7RE: Holiday PartyWhat a diverse group we are! I had no idea that December 20 begins theMuslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating and drinking duringdaylight hours. There goes the party! Seriously, we can appreciate how aluncheon this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees'beliefs. Perhaps Luigi's can hold off on serving your meal until the endof the party-the days are so short this time of year-or else packageeverything for take home in little foil swans. Will that work? Meanwhile,

I've arranged for members of Overeaters Anonymous to sit farthest from thedessert buffet. Pregnant women will get the table closest to therestrooms. Gays are allowed to sit with each other. Lesbians do not haveto sit with Gay men, each will have their own table. Yes, there will beflower arrangement for the Gay men's table. To the person askingpermission to cross dress, no cross dressing allowed, though. We will havebooster seats for short people. Low-fat food will be available for thoseon a diet. We cannot control the salt used in the food we suggest forthose people with high blood problems to taste first. There will be freshfruits as dessert for Diabetics, the restaurant cannot supply "No Sugar"desserts. Sorry! Did I miss anything?

Patty============================================FROM: Patty Lewis, Human Resources DirectorTO: All EmployeesDATE: December 8RE: Holiday PartySo, December 22 marks the Winter Solstice.

..

? What do you expect me to do,

a tap-dance on your heads? Fire regulations at Luigi's prohibit theburning of sage by our "earth-based Goddess-worshiping" employees, butwe'll try to accommodate your shamanic drumming circle during the band'sbreaks. Okay?

??

Patty============================================FROM: Patty Lewis, Human Resources DirectorTO: All EmployeesDATE: December 9RE: HolidayParty People, people! Nothing sinister was intended by having our CEOdress up like Santa Claus! Even if the anagram of "Santa" does happen tobe "Satan," there is no evil connotation to our own "little man in a redsuit." It's a tradition, folks, like sugar shock at Halloween, or familyfeuds over the thanksgiving turkey, or broken hearts on Valentine's Day.

Could we lighten up? Please?

Two executives working in the garment center are having lunch together. Goldstein says to his friend, "Last week was one of the worst weeks of my entire life."

"What happened?" asks Birnbaum.

Goldstein moans, "My wife and I went to Florida on vacation. It rained for seven days and seven nights, so my wife went out and spent thousands of dollars on the credit card. I came back to New York and found out that my brother-in-law accountant has been ripping me off for millions.

"You think you had a bad week?" responds Birnbaum. "My week was even worse! I went to Florida on vacation with my wife and it rained for seven days and seven nights, so my wife went out and spent thousands on the credit card.

The Perfect Worker1 Bob Smith, my assistant programmer, can always be found2 hard at work in his cubicle.  Bob works independently, without3 wasting company time talking to colleagues.  Bob never4 thinks twice about assisting fellow employees, and he always5 finishes given assignments on time.  Often he takes extended6 measures to complete his work, sometimes skipping coffee7 breaks.  Bob is a dedicated individual who has absolutely no8 vanity in spite of his high accomplishments and profound9 knowledge in his field.  I firmly believe that Bob can be10 classed as a high-caliber employee, the type which cannot be11 dispensed with.  Consequently, I duly recommend that Bob be12 promoted to executive management, and a proposal will be13 executed as soon as possible.

Addendum:That idiot was standing over my shoulder while I wrote the reportsent to you earlier today.  Kindly re-read only the odd numberedlines.

Have you all stopped to think where you fit in this equation? From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it  goes like this: What makes 100%?  What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?

We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? Here?

?s a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M  N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26Then:H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 =  98%K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 =  96%But,

A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 =  100%And,

B-U-L-L-S-H-*-T21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%AND, look how far ass kissing will take  you:A-S-S?

?K-I-S-S-I-N-G1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = a whopping 118%!

!!

!So one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that:While Hard work and Knowledge will get you close and Attitude willget you there, Bullsh*t and  Ass Kissing will put you over the top!

from a Company in USA. DATE:    October 01, 2003RE:         Christmas Party       I'm happy to inform you that the company Christmas Party will take place on December 23, starting at noon in the private function room at the Grill House. There will be a cash bar and plenty of drinks! We'll have a small band playing traditional carols.

..

feel free to sing along. And don't be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus! A Christmas tree will be lit at 1:00pm. Exchange of gifts among employees can be done at that time; however, no gift should be over $10.

00 to make the giving of gifts easy for everyone's pockets. This gathering is only for employees! Our CEO will make a special announcement at that time!      Merry Christmas to you and your family.      Patty      ===============================================================      FROM:    Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director      TO:         All Employees      DATE:    October 02, 2003      RE:         Holiday Party       In no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees.  We recognize that Chanukah is an important holiday, which often coincides with Christmas, though unfortunately not this year. However, from now on we're calling it our "Holiday Party." The same policy applies to any other employees who are not C! hristians or those still celebrating Reconciliation Day. There will be no Christmas tree present. No Christmas carols sung. We will have other types of music for your enjoyment.      Happy now?      Happy Holidays to you and your family.      Patty        ===============================================================            FROM:   Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director      TO:        All Employees      DATE:   October 03, 2003      RE:        Holiday Party       Regarding the note I received from a member of Alco! holics Anonymous requesting a non-drinking table .

.. you didn't sign your name. I'm happy to accommodate this request, but if I put a sign on a table that reads, "AA Only"; you wouldn't be anonymous anymore. How am I supposed to handle this?      Somebody?      Forget about the gifts exchange, no gifts exchange are allowed since the union members feel that $10.

00 is too much money and executives believe $10.

00 is a little chintzy.      NO GIFTS EXCHANGE WILL BE ALLOWED.

===============================================================      FROM:  Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director      To:        All Employees      DATE:   October 04, 2003      RE:        Holiday Party           What a diverse group we are! I had no idea that December 20 begins the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating and drinking during daylight hours. There goes the party! Seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon at this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees' beliefs. Perhaps the Grill House can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party- or else package everything for you to take it home in little foil doggy baggy. Will that work? Meanwhile, I've arranged for members of Weight Watchers to sit farthest from  The dessert buffet and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms. Gays are allowed to sit with each other. Lesbians do not have to sit with Gay men, each will have their own table. Yes, there will be flower arrangement for the Gay men'! s table. To the person asking permission to cross dress, no cross-dressing allowed though. We will have booster seats for short people. Low-fat food will be available for those on a diet. We cannot control the salt used in the food we suggest for those people with high blood pressure to taste first. There will be fresh fruits as dessert for Diabetics, the restaurant cannot supply "No Sugar" desserts. Sorry!      Did I miss anything?

!?

!?      Patty        ===============================================================            FROM:   Patty Lewis, Human Resources Director      TO:         All Fucking Employees      DATE:    October  05, 2003      RE:         The Fucking Holiday Party             Vegetarian pricks I've had it with you people!

!! We're going to keep this party at the Grill House whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table furthest from the "grill of death," as you so quaintly put it, and you'll get your fucking salad bar, including organic tomatoes. But you know, tomatoes have feelings, too. They scream when you slice them. I've heard them scream. I'm hearing them scream right NOW! I hope you all have a rotten holiday! Drive drunk and die,       The Bitch from HELL!

In the meantime, management has decided to cancel our Holiday Party and give everyone the afternoon of the 23rd off with full pay.             Happy Holidays

A blonde decided that she was tired of her empty life.  She cut her hair and dyed it brown, and set off for a drive.  She wanted to do random acts of kindness to see if it would change her life.

While driving through the countryside, she came across a farmer who was trying to get his sheep across the road.  She stopped her car and waved the farmer across, thinking this would be her first good deed.

After the sheep had all crossed, the blonde said to the farmer, "your sheep are so cute.  If I guess how many there are, could I have one."The farmer thought it impossible and told the blonde it was okay."637", said the blonde.

The farmer was amazed that the blonde had guessed the exact number, but lived up to his bargain."I'll take that feisty one over there", said the blonde.

Then the farmer said to the blonde, "Okay, now if I guess the real color of your hair, can I have my dog back?

Judi was bored with driving her BMW. It laced individuality and besides that, every other girl in the office had one. She fancied something a bit more individual, perhaps an MG convertible.

That week she visited her local car dealer and spied a beautiful Jaguar XK140 convertible. It was wonderfully restored and she fell in love with its gorgeous red paint work. An empty check stub later and off she was tearing down the leafy country lanes enjoying her beautiful new car. Her long blonde hair was flowing in the wind, music blaring from the radio, what could possibly go wrong?

At that thought there was a splutter from the engine and the car slowly coasted to a stop. She got out and lifted the bonnet and concluded after a few minutes that she didn't have a bloody clue what was wrong. Luckily she had her mobile phone with her and a quick phone call to the AutoClub and a short wait saw a bright shiny yellow van pull up behind her."That's a lovely car," said the mechanic. "What seems to be the matter?

Judi replied, "Well, it just conked out I'm afraid."

"Let me have look." He set to work and ten minutes later the engine was purring like a cat again."Thank goodness," she said. "What was the matter?"

"Simple really, just crap in the carburetor," he replied.

Looking shocked she asked, "Oh. How many times a week do I have to do that?"

A man lay sprawled across three entire seats in the posh theater.  When the usher came by and noticed this, he  whispered to the man, "Sorry, sir, but you're only allowed one seat."  The man groaned but didn't budge.  The usher became impatient.    "Sir, if you don't get up from  there I'm going to have to call the manager."    Again, the man just groaned, which infuriated the usher who turned and marched briskly back up the aisle in search of his manager. In a few moments, both the usher and the manager returned and stood over the man.  Together the two of them tried repeatedly to move him, but with no success. Finally, they summoned the police.    The cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked, "All right buddy, what's your name?"    "Sam," the man moaned.    "Where ya from, Sam?" With pain in his voice Sam replied "the balcony."

More Jesse news.

.. Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson Due to the great consternation caused by the revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my obligation to give an explanation to thepopulation for my act of copulation. I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through masturbation, resulted in my fornication. I accepted her invitation,

and provided her with excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and liberation. She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried for duplication but I insisted upon termination, in spite her fascination with variation. This has caused me great aggravation, and the agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in my humiliation,

denigration, and degradation. My wife is considering castration, whichwould require my hospitalization. Pray that this matter will find culmination in my sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in revocation and termination. I hope this proclamation has provided illumination and verification and will prohibit further provocation. Sincerely, The Rev. Jesse Jackson

The following is a "history" collected by teachers throughout theUnited States, from eighth grade through college level. Read carefully,

and you will learn a lot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-        The inhabitants of ancient Egypt were called mummies. Theylived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate ofthe Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere, socertain areas of the dessert are cultivated by irritation. TheEgyptians built the Pyramids in the shape of a huge triangular cube.

The Pyramids are a range of mountains between France and Spain.        The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the firstbook of the Bible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from anapple tree. On of their children, Cain, once asked, "Am I my brother'sson?" God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on Mount Montezuma. Jacob,

son of Isaac, stole his brother's birth mark. Jacob was a patriarchwho brought up his twelve sons to be patriarchs, but they did nottake it. One of Jacob's sons, Joseph, gave refuse to the Israelites.        Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw.

Moses led them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, whichis bread made without any ingredients. Afterwards, Moses went up onMount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. David was a Hebrew kingskilled at playing the liar. He fought with the Philatelists, a raceof people who lived in the Biblical times. Soloman, one of David'ssons, had 500 wives and 500 porcupines.        Without the Greeks we wouldn't have history. The Greeksinvented three kinds of columns - Corinthian, Doric, and Ironic. Theyalso had myths. A myth is a female moth. One myth says that themother of Achilles dipped him in the River Stynx until he becameintollerable. Achilles appears in The Iliad, by Homer. Homer alsowrote The Oddity, in which Penelope was the last hardship thatUlysses endured on his journey. Actually, Homer was not written byHomer but by another man of that name.        Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around givingpeople advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose ofwedlock.        In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled thebiscuits, the threw the java. The reward to the victor was a coralwreath. The government of Athens was democratic because people tookthe law into their own hands. There were no wars in Greece, as themountains were so high that they couldn't climb over to see whattheir neighbors were doing. When they fought with the Persians, theGreeks were outnumbered because the Persians had more men.        Eventually, the Ramons conquered the Greeks. History callspeople Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long.

At Roman banquets, the guests wore garlic in their hair. JuliusCaesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides ofMarch murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king.

Nero was a cruel tyranny who would turture his poor subjects byplaying the fiddle to them.

Then came the Middle Ages. King Alfred conquered the Dames.

King Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery, King Harold mustarded histroops before the Battle of Hastings, Joan of Arc was canonized byBernard Shaw, and victims of the Black Death grew boobs on theirnecks. Finally, Magna Carta provided that no free man should behanged twice for the same offense.        In medevil time most of the people were alliterate. Thegreatest writer of the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems andversus and also wrote literature. Another tale tells of WilliamTell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on hisson's head.        The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals feltthe value of their human being. Martin Luther was nailed to thechurch door at Wittenberg for selling papal indulgences. He dieda horrible death, being excommunicated by a bull. It was thepainter Donatello's interes in the female nude that made him thefather of the Renaissance. It was an age of great inventions anddiscoveries. Gutenberg invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh isa historical figure because he invented cigarettes. Anotherimportant invention was the circulation of blood. Sir FrancisDrake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.        The government of England was a limited mockery. HenryVIII found walking difficult because he had an abbess on his knee.

Queen Elizabeth was the "Virgin Queen." As a queen she was asuccess. When Elizabeth exposed herself before her troops, they allshouted, "hurrah." Then her navy went out and defeated the SpanishArmadillo.        The greatest write of the Renaissance was William Shakespear.

Shakespear never made much money and is only famous because of hisplays. He lived at Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies,

comedies and errors. In one of Shakespear's famous plays, Hamletrations out his situation by relieving himself in a long soliloquy.

In another, Lady Macbeth tried to convince Macbeth to kill the Kindby attack his manhood. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroiccouplet. Writing at the same time as Shakespear was Miguel Cervantes.

He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Miltonwrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.        During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus wasa great navigator who discovered America while cursing about theAtlantic. His ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe.

Later, the Pilgrims crossed the Ocean, and this was known asPilgrims Progress. When they landed at Plymouth Rock, they weregreeted by the Indians, who came down the hill rolling their war hoopsbefore them. The Indian squabs carried porpoises on their back. Manyof the Indian heroes were killed, along with their cabooses, whichproved very fatal for them. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for thesettlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain JohnSmith was responsible for all this.

B-I-K-E"; as he again   touched the tip of the little boys nose with his finger. The little   boy again said"Nope".   Well santa's starting to get a little pissed off. So he thinks to   himself that he'll try one more time. So he says to the little boy"I   bet you want a fire engine,

F-I-R-E-E-N-G-I-N-E"; once again touching   the tip of the little boys nose with his finger after every letter of   the word. Where to the little responds"Nope".   Well at this time santa's really pissed off. So he says to the little   boy "Then what the fuck do you want for christmas"?   The little boy then looked at santa and said"I want some pussy,   P-U-S-S-Y; and don't fucking tell me that you can't give me any   because I can smell it on your finger"!

THE IRS LETTER.

..      Dear Sirs:   I am responding to your letter denying the deduction for two of the   three dependents I claimed on my 1996 Federal Tax return. Thank you. I   have questioned whether these are my children or not for years. They   are evil and expensive.   It's only fair, since they are minors and not my responsbility, that   the government (who evidently is taxing me more to care for these waifs)   knows something about them and what to expect over the next year. You   may apply next year to reassign them to me and reinstate the   deduction.   This year they are yours!   The oldest, Kristen, is now 17. She is brillant. Ask her! I suggest   you put her to work in your office where she can answer people's   questions about their returns. While she has no formal training, it   has not seemed to hamper her knowledge of any other subject you can name.   Taxes should be a breeze. Next year she is going to college. I think   it's wonderful that you will now be responsible for that little   expense. While you mull that over, keep in mind that she has a truck.   It doesn't run at the moment so you have the immediate decision of   appropriating some Department of Defense funds to fix the vehicle or   getting up early to drive her to school.   Kristen also has a boyfriend. Oh joy. While she possesses all of the   wisdom of the universe, her alleged mother and I have felt it best to   occasionally remind her of the virtues of abstinence, and in the face   of overwhelming passion, safe sex. This is always uncomfortable and I am   quite relieved you will be handling this in the future. May I suggest   that you reinstate Jocelyn Elders who had a rather good handle on the   problem.   Patrick is 14. I've had my suspicions about this one. His eyes are a   little close together for normal people. He may be a tax examiner   himself one day if you do not incarcerate him first. In February, I   was awakened at three in the morning by a police officer who was bringing   Pat home. He and his friends were TP'ing houses. Kids at 14 will do   almost anything on a dare. His hair is purple. Permanent dye,   temporary dye, what the big deal? Learn to deal with it. You'll have   plenty of time as he is sitting out a few days of school after   instigating a food fight. I'll take care of filing your phone number   with the vice principal. Oh yes, he and all of his friends have raging   hormones. This is the house of testosterone and it will be much more   peaceful when he lives in your home. DO NOT leave any of them   unsupervised with girls, explosives, inflammables, inflatables,   vehicles, or telephones. (I'm sure that you will find telephones a   source of unimaginable amusement, and be sure to lock out the 900 and   976 numbers!

).   Heather is an alien. She slid through a time warp and appeared quite   by magic one year. I'm sure this one is yours. She is 10 going on 21.   She came from a bad trip in the sixties. She wears tie-dyed clothes,   beads, sandals, and hair that looks like Tiny Tim's. Fortunately you   will be raising my taxes to help offset the pinch of her remedial   reading courses. Hooked on Phonics is expensive so the schools dropped   it. Good news! You can buy it yourself for half the amount of the   deduction that you are denying!   It's quite obvious that we are terrible parents (ask the other two) so   they've helped raise this child to a new level of terror. She cannot   speak English. Most people under eighteen can understand the curious   lingo she fashioned out of valley girls/boys in the odd/reggae/yuppie/   political doublespeak. I don't. The school sends her to a speech   pathologist who has her roll her R's. It added a refreshing   Mexican/Irish touch to her voice. She wears hats backwards, pants   baggy and wants one of her ears pierced four more times. There is a   fascination with tattoos that worries me but I am sure that you can   handle it. Bring a truck when you come to get her, she sort of "nests"   in her room and I think that it would be easier to move the entire   thing than find out what it is really made of.   You denied two of the three exemptions so it is only fair you get to   pick which two you will take. I prefer that you take the youngest, I   still go bankrupt with Kristen's college but then I am free! If you   take the two oldest then I still have time for counseling before   Heather becomes a teenager. If you take the two girls then I won't feel so bad   about putting Patrick in a military academy. Please let me know of   your decision as soon as possible as I have already increased the   withholding on my W-4 to cover the $395 in additional tax and made a down payment   on an airplane.   Sincerly,

There was a boy who worked in the produce section of the market. One day, a man came in andasked to buy half a head of lettuce. The boy told him that they only sold whole heads of lettuce, but the man replied that he did not need a whole head, but only a half head. The boy said he would go ask his manager about the matter.

The boy walked into the back room and said, "there is some asshole out there who wants to buy only a half a head of lettuce." As he was finishing saying this he turned around to find the man standing right behind him, so he added, "and this gentleman wants to buy the other half".

The manager okayed the deal and the man went on his way. Later the manager called on the boy and said, "you almost got yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressedwith the way you got yourself out of it. You think on your feet and we like that around here.

Where are you from son?" The boy replied, "Minnesota sir"."Oh really? Why did you leave Minnesota" asked the manager. The boy replied, "They're all just whores and hockey players up there." The manager was shocked and replied "My wife is from Minnesota!

The Wisdom of Youth Never give up because life gets harder   as you get older.   After preschool the road of life keeps getting bumpier and bumpier and   bumpier. Angela Martin, age 11   Never blow in a cat's ear because if you do, usually after three or   four times, they will bite your lips! And they don't let go for at   least a minute. Lisa Coburn, age 9   Don't think life is easy, because when you get older it is hard work.   I used to think life was easy, now I have to do the dishes every other   day. Nick Coleman, age 9   Take risks. I mean, if you like this person and you don't know if they   like you, ask them out and see what happens. I liked this girl and I   asked her out. She said no and she hates me now, but I took that risk.   Bruce Wagner, age 13   A realist is more correct about things in life than an optimist. But   the optimist seems to have more friends and much more fun. Megan, age   14   When they broke open molecules, they found they were only stuffed with   atoms. But when they broke open atoms, they found them stuffed with   explosions. When people run around and around in circles we say they   are crazy. When planets do it we say they are orbiting. Rainbows are   just to look at, not to really understand. Someday we may discover how   to make magnets that can point in any direction. A vibration is a   motion that cannot make up its mind which way it wants to go. Many   dead animals in the past changed to fossils while others preferred to   be oil. Genetics explain why you look like your father and if you   don't why you should. Vacuums are nothings. We only mention them to   let them know we know they're there. Some oxygen molecules help fires   burn while others help make water, so sometimes it's brother against   brother.

Excuse me, but do you know me?" And the little girl says, ?

No, but I know what you've been doing.

A kindergartner was practicing spelling with magnetic letters on the refrigerator: cat, dog, dad, and mom had been proudly displayed for all to see. One morning while getting ready for the day, he bounded into the room with his arms outstretched. In his hands were three magnetic letters: G-O-D. "Look what I spelled, Mom!" with a proud smile on his face. "That's wonderful!" his mom praised him. "Now go put them on the fridge so Dad can see when he gets home tonight." The mom happily thought that her son's Catholic education was certainly having an impact. Just then, a little voice called from the kitchen: "Mom? How do you spell 'zilla'?"

He dialed the employee's home phone number and was greeted with a child's whispered, "Hello?"Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to theyoungster, the boss asked, "Is your Daddy home?"

"Yes," whispered the small voice."May I talk with him?" the man asked.

To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, "No."Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "Is your Mommy there?"Yes," came the answer."May I talk with her?"Again the small voice whispered, "No."Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left homealone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the personwho should be there watching over the child."Is there anyone there besides you?" the boss asked the child."Yes," whispered the child, "a policeman."Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the bossasked, "May I speak with the policeman?"

"No, he's busy," whispered the child."Busy doing what?" asked the boss."Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman," came the whisperedanswer.

Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like ahelicopter through the ear piece on the phone, the boss asked, "Whatis that noise?"

"A hello-copper," answered the whispering voice."What is going on there?" asked the boss, now alarmed.

In an awed whispering voice, the child answered, "The search teamjust landed the hello-copper."Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated, the bossasked, "What are they searching for?"Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffledgiggle, "Me."

It was the first day of school and a new student named Martinez, the son of a Mexican restaurateur, entered the fourth grade. The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American history. Who said "Give me Liberty, or give me Death?" She saw a sea of blankfaces, except for Martinez, who had his hand up. "Patrick Henry, 1775." "Very good! Who said 'Government of the people, by the people, for thepeople, shall not perish from the earth'"? Again, no response except from Martinez: "Abraham Lincoln, 1863.", saidMartinez. The teacher snapped at the class, "Class, you should be ashamed.

Martinez, who is new to our country, knows more about its history thanyou do." She heard a loud whisper: "Screw the Mexicans."

"Who said that?" she demanded. Martinez put his hand up. "Jim Bowie, 1836." At that point, a student in the back said, "I'm gonna puke." The teacher glares and asks "All right! Now, who said that?" Again, Martinez says, "George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991." Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Suck this!" Martinez jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to theteacher, "Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!" Now with almost a mob hysteria someone said, "You little shit. If yousay anything else, I'll kill you." Martinez frantically yells at the top of his voice, "Gary Condit toChandra Levy 2001." The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, "Oh shit, we're in BIG trouble!" Martinez said, "Saddam Hussein 2003."

The Technologically Challenged        Just in case you think YOU are TC (technologically challenged), there'sstill hope:1. Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to "Press   Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the "Any" key   is.

2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse   was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to   be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.

3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining   that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old   (5-1/4") diskettes.  After troubleshooting for magnets and heat   failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer   had labeled the diskettes, then rolled them into the typewriter   to type the labels.

4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective   diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along   with photocopies of the floppies.

5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy   back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to   hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and going   across the room to close the door.

6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer   to fax anything. After 40 minutes of troubleshooting, the technician   discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it   in front of the monitor screen and hitting the "send" key.

7. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no   longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and   water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys   and washing them individually.

8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged   because his computer had told him he was "bad and an invalid".  The   tech explained that the computer's "bad command" and "invalid"   responses shouldn't be taken personally.

9. A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents.   He told the technician that the computer had said it "couldn't find   printer."  The user had even tried turning the computer screen to   face the printer - but his computer still couldn't "see" the printer.

10.

An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get   her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was   plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed   the power button.  Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot   pedal and nothing happened." The "foot pedal" turned out to be the   mouse!

11.

Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her   brand-new computer wouldn't work. She said she unpacked the unit,   plugged it in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to   happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch,   she asked "What power switch?"12.

True story from a Novell NetWire  SysOp:   Caller: "Hello, is this  Tech Support?"   Tech:   "Yes, it is. How may I help you?"   Caller: "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my            warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?"   Tech:   "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?"   Caller: "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer."   Tech:   "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, it's because I am.            Did you receive this as part of a promotion, at a trade show?            How did you get this cup holder? Does it have any trademark            on it?"   Caller: "It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a            promotion.  It just has '4X' on it."   At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he   couldn't stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been   using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and   snapped it off the drive.

13.

Another IBM customer had troubles installing software and rang   for support. "I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to   put in the second disk, and I had some problems with the disk, but I   squeezed it in.  When it said to put in the third disk - I couldn't   even fit it in.

.." The user hadn't realized that "Insert Disk 2"   meant to remove Disk 1 first.

Girlfriend Tech Support E-mail        I am currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I've beenhaving some problems lately.  I've been running the same version ofDrinkingBuddies 1.

0 forever as my primary application, and all theGirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.  I hearthat DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background modeand the sound is turned off.  But I'm embarrassed to say I can't findthe switch to turn the sound off.  I just run them separately, and itworks okay.

Girlfriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Fishing 97program, often trying to abort Fishing 97 with some sort of timingincompatibility. I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.

0, butI thought I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.

0.  Aftermonths of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has hadexperience with GirlFriend 2.

0.  He said I probably didn't have enoughcache to run GirlFriend 2.

0, and eventually it would require a TokenRing to run properly.  He was right - as soon as I purged my cache, ituninstalled itself.

Shortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.

0 beta.  All the bugs weresupposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virusanyway. I had to clean out my whole system and shut down for a while.  Ivery cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.

0. This time I used a SCSIprobe first and also installed a virus protection program.  It workedokay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend 1.

0 was still in mysystem.  I tried running GirlFriend 1.

0 again with GirlFriend 4.

0 stillinstalled, but GirlFriend 4.

0 has a feature I didn't know about thatautomatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend andcommunicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removalof both versions.

The version I have now works pretty well, but there are still someproblems. Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscurelanguage I can't understand, much less reprogram.  Frankly I think thereis too much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desiredfunctionality.  Also, to get the best connections with your hardware,

you usually have to use gold-plated contacts.  And I've never liked howGirlFriend is totally "object-oriented."A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend toGirlFriendPlus 1.

0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version ofGirlFriend.  He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.

0 expires within a yearif you don't upgrade to Fiancee 1.

0.  So he did, but soon after that, hehad to upgrade to Wife 1.

0 which he describes as a huge resource hog.

It has taken up all his space, so he can't load anything else.  One ofthe primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.

0 was because it camebundled with FreeSexPlus.  Well, it turns out the resource allocationmodule of Wife 1.

0 sometimes prohibits access to FreeSexPlus,

particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try.  On top of that, Wife1.

0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he can doanything.  Although he did not ask for it, Wife 1.

0 came withMotherInLaw which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off.  Itold him to try installing Mistress 1.

0, but he said he heard if you tryto run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.

0, Wife 1.

0 will deleteMSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself.  Then Mistress 1.

0won't install anyway because of insufficient resources.

Any Ideas?

Diary of an AOL User        July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is thebest online service I can get.  They even included a free disk!  I'd betterhold onto it in case they don't ever send me anther one!  I can't connect.

I don't know what is wrong.

July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs amodem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he thinkI am?

July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It wouldn'tfit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused.

July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked up. that nine year old nextdoor did it for me. But it still don't work. I cant get online.

July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America Onlinefor me. He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy.  But he says that'sjust another service. What a modest kid.  He's so smart and he does theseservices for people.  Anyway he's smarter then the jerks who sold me themodem. They didn't even tell me about communications software. Bet theydidn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack holes in the back of amodem when you only need one?  And why do they have one labeled phone whenyou are not suppose to hook it to the phone jack on the wall?  I thoughtthe dial tone sounded funny! Boy, are modem makers dumb!  But the kid figuredit out by the sound.

July 26 - What's the internet?  I thought I was on America Online. Not thisinternet thing. I'm confused.

July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this AmericaOnline stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he is comparedto me.  Maybe he's not so modest after all.

July 28 - I tried to use chat today.  I tried to talk into my computer butnothing happened. maybe I need to buy a microphone.

July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because I'mconnected to America Online not usenet.

July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital letters.

How do they do that?  I never figured out how to type capital letters.

Maybe they have a different type of keyboard.

JULY 31 -  I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN ABOUTNOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT WAS THIS CAPSLOCK KEY.  WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I GOT A CHEAP KEYBOARDAND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS ISNT THE SAME SIZE AS THEOTHER. HE SAID THATS A STANDARD. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T WANT A STANDARDKEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND. I MUST HAVE HAD AN IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE IHEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT GUYS TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION.

AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT CANANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEINTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON.

AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.

HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS JOKEABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA! HA!

I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES.

AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DON'T NOW SPIDERSGREW THAT LARGE.

AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS RUDE.  IWAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO REC.

HUMOR.

ORACLE. IWASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE TIMES.

AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO USEPROFANITY.

AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES. WHATA STUPID JERK. IM NOT SHOUTING! IM NOT EVEN TALKING! JUST TYPING!  HOW CANTHEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET?

August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it? Itsprobably an extra feature that costs more money.

August 8 - I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so exited.

I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions and posted itto every newsgroup I could find.

August 9 - I just made my signature file.  Its only 6 pages long. I willhave to work on it some more.

August 10 - I just looked at a group called alt.

aol.

sucks. I read a fewposts and I really believe that aol should be wiped off the face of theearth. I wonder what an aol is.

August 11 - I was asking where to find some information about something.

Some guy told me to check out ftp.

netcom.

com. I've looked and looked but Ican't find that group.

August 12 - I sent a post to every usenet group on the Internet askingwhere the ftp.

netcom.

com is. hopefully someone will help. I cant ask the kidnext door. His parents said that when he comes back from my house he'slaughing so hard he can't eat or sleep or do his homework. So they wont lethim come over anymore. I do have a great sense of humor. I don't know whythe rec.

humor group didn't like my chicken joke. Maybe they only like dirtystuff. Some people sent me posts about my 56 posts of the joke and theyused bad words.

August 13 - I sent another post to every usenet group on the Internetasking where the ftp.

netcom.

com is. I had forgot yesterday to include my newsignature file which is only 8 pages long. I know everyone will want toread my favorite poem so I included it. I'm also going to add that short storyIlike.

August 14 - Some guy suspended my account because of what I was doing. Itold him I don't have an account at his bank. He's so dumb.

Less-Known Computer Languages        Basic-Fortran-Cobol.

.. Theseprogramming languages are wellknown and (more or less) wellloved throughout the computerindustry.

There are numerous otherlanguages however that are lesswell known yet still have ardentdevotees. In fact these little-known languages generallyhave the most fanatic admirers.

For those who wish to know moreabout these obscure languages -and why they are obscure - Ipresent the following catalog.

SIMPLE .

.. SIMPLE is an acronymfor Sheer Idiot's Mono  PurposeProgramming LingusiticEnvironment.

This language developed at theHanover College for TechnologicalMisfits was designed to make itimpossible to write code witherrors in it. The statements aretherefore confined to BEGIN-END-and STOP. No matter how youarrange the statements you can'tmake a syntax error.

Programs written in SIMPLE donothing useful.

Thus they achievethe results of programs writtenin other languages without thetedious frustrating process oftesting and debugging.

SLOBOL .

.. SLOBOL is best knownfor the speed or lack of it  ofits compiler. Although manycompilers allow you to take acoffee break while they compileSLOBOL compilers allow you to takea trip to Bolivia to pick up thecoffee. Forty-three programmersare known to have died of boredomsitting at their terminals whilewaiting for a SLOBOL program tocompile.

Weary SLOBOL programmers often turnto a related (but infinitely faster) language.

..

COCAINE.

VALGOL .

.. (With special thanks toDan and Betsy "Moon Unit" Pfau)- From its modest beginnings insouthern California's SanFernando Valley VALGOL is enjoyinga dramatic surge of popularityacross the industry.

VALGOL commands include REALLY-LIKE - WELL and YAKNOW. Variablesare assigned with the =LIKE and=TOTALLY operators.

Other operatorsinclude the "CALIFORNIA BOOLEANS"FERSURE and NOWAY. Repetitions ofcode are handled in FOR-SURE loops.

Here is a sample VALGOL program. 14 LIKE-YAKNOW (I MEAN) START. %% IF. PI A =LIKE BITCHEN AND. 01 B =LIKE TUBULAR AND. 9 C =LIKE GRODY**MAX. 4K (FERSURE)**2. 18 THEN. 4I FOR I=LIKE 1 TO OH MAYBE 100. 86 DO WAH + (DITTY**2). 9 BARF(I) =TOTALLY GROSS(OUT). -17 SURE. 1F LIKE BAG THIS PROGRAM. ? REALLY. $$ LIKE TOTALLY (Y*KNOW)VALGOL is characterized by itsunfriendly error messages. Forexample when the user makes asyntax error the interpreterdisplays the message GAG ME WITHA SPOON!

LAIDBACK .

.. Historically VALGOL isa derivative of  LAIDBACK  whichwas developed at the (now defunct)Marin County Center for T'ai ChiMellowness and ComputerProgramming as an analternative to themore intense atmosphere in nearbysilicon valley. The center wasideal for programmers who liked tosoak in  hot tubs while theyworked. Unfortunately fewprogrammers could survive therefor long since the center outlawedpizza and RC  Cola in favor of beancurd and Perrier.

Many mourn the demise of LAIDBACKbecause its reputation as agentle and nonthreatening language.

For example LAIDBACK responded tosyntax errors with the messageSORRY MAN I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT.

SARTRE .

.. Named after the lateexistential philosopher.

SARTRE isan extremely unstructuredlanguage. Statements in SARTRE haveno purpose they are just there.

Thus  SARTRE programs are left todefine their own functions.

SARTRE programmers tend to beboring and depressed and are nofun at  parties.

FIFTH .

.. FIFTH is a precisionmathematical language in  whichthe data types refer to quantity.

The data types range from  CC-OUNCE-SHOT and JIGGER to FIFTH(hence the name of the language)LITER-MAGNUM and BLOTTO.

Commands refer to ingredientssuch as CHABLIS-CHARDONNAY-CABERNET-GIN-VERMOUTH-VODKA-SCOTCHand WHATEVERSAROUND.

The many versions of the FIFTHlanguage reflect the sophisticationand financial status of its users.

Commands in the ELITE dialectinclude VSOP and LAFITE whilecommands in the GUTTER dialectinclude HOOTCH and RIPPLE.

The latter is a  favorite offrustrated FORTH programmers whoend up using the language.

C-.

..

This language was namedfor the grade received by itscreater when he submitted itas a class project in agraduate programming class.

C- is best described as a'Low Level' programminglanguage.

In fact the languagegenerally requires more C-statements than machine-codestatements to execute a giventask. In this respect itis very similar to COBOL.

LITHP .

.. This otherwiseunremarkable language isdistinguished by the absenceof an "s" in its character set.

Programmers and users mustsubstitute"TH". LITHP is said tobe useful in prothething lithtth.

DOGO .

.. Developed at theMassachussettes Institute ofObedience Training. DOGO heraldsa new era of computer literatepets. DOGO commands include SITSTAY-HEEL and ROLL OVER. Aninnovative feature of DOGO is'PUPPY GRAPHICS' in which a smallcocker spaniel occasionally leavesa deposit as he travels acrossthe screen.

The husband finally wised up to the fact that his wife was less than faithful. He hired a private investigator to follow her and inless than a week, had all the information that he needed on the "other man".

The husband convinced himself that his would still be a loving and trustworthy marriage had not this S.

O.

B. come onto thescene. Being a man of the 90's and all, he decided to handle the matter in what he judged to be sophisticated and business-likemanner.

He sent the following e-mail to his wife's lover:     Sir,     It has been brought to my attention that for some time now you have been carrying on an affair with my     wife. So that we may settle this matter in an intelligent fashion, please be at my office at 3 PM on Friday     next.

The "other man" was highly amused by the husband's formal manner and sent off the following reply at once:     Dear Sir,     I have received a copy of your mass mailing this morning. You may be advised that I will attend the     scheduled conference in your Office's auditorium.

Process-Oriented God           If God was process oriented, the Book of Genesis might read something like                                              this:             In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.  The earth was             without form and void, so God created a small committee.  He carefully           balanced the committee vis-a-vis race, gender, ethnic origin, and economic               status in order to interface pluralism with the holistic concept of                    self-determination according to adjudicatory guidelines.                          Even God was impressed, and so ended the first day.           And God said, "Let the committee draw up a mission statement."  And behold,             the committee decided to prioritize and strategize and God called that                  process empowerment.  And God thought it sounded pretty good.                              And evening and morning were the second day.           And God said, "Let the committee determine goals and objectives and engage               in long-term planning."  Unfortunately, a debate about the semantic           differences between goals and objectives pre-empted almost all of the third           day.  Although the question was never satisfactorily resolved, God thought                                  the process was constructive.                              And evening and morning were the third day.            And God said, "Let there be a retreat in which the committee can envision               functional organization and engage in planning by objectives."  The          committee considered adjustment of priorities and consequential alternatives          to program directions, and God saw that this was good.  And God thought that              it was even worth all of the coffee and donuts that he had to supply.                                      And so ended the fourth day.          And God said, "Let the committee be implemented with long-range planning and           strategy."  The committee considered guidelines and linkages and structural            sensitivities, and alternatives and implemental models.  And God saw that                                    this was very democratic.                  And so would have ended the fifth day, except for the unintentional            renewal of the debate about the differences between goals and objectives.          On the sixth day the committee agreed on criteria for adjudicatory assessment          and evaluation.  This wasn't the agenda that God had planned.  He wasn't able           to attend, however, because he had to take the afternoon off to create day           and night and heaven and earth and seas and plants and stars and trees and           seasons and years and sun and moon and birds and fish and animals and human                                             beings.                  On the seventh day God rested and the committee submitted its           recommendations.  It turned out that the recommended forms for things were             nearly identical to the way that God had created them; so the committee           passed a resolution commending God for his implementation according to the           guidelines.  There was, however, some opinion expressed that people should                           have been created in the committee's image.                  And God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the committee . . .

Just wanted to check out that you gnarly dudes are using the latest andgreatest software technology fer yer rad code to make it easy for thedudes who have to read it.  The hip new way to write readable Ccode involves the use of a few simple defines.

#define like {#define man ;}#define an ;#define SayBro /*#define CheckItOut */SayBro like, this is some rad program, so CheckItOutlike    a = b         an    c = dmanSayBro , like who needs help from them compiler choads anyway?

THIS is the way to write CLEAR code.  I mean really!  CheckItOutlike SayBro this is ShellSort straight out of the white book, but ina readable form.

God's Human DNA CodeFor many years molecular biologists have been mystified by the fact that verylittle of an organism's DNA seems to serve any useful function. I have solved the mystery. The reason why only 30% of human DNA performs any useful function is that therest of it is comments. Once we decode a typical human genome, we see that the contents begin asfollows: ===/* HUMAN_DNA.

The Story of Micro and MiniMicro was a real-time operator and dedicated multi-user. His broad-bandprotocol made it easy for him to interface with numerous input/output devices,

even if it meant time-sharing.

One evening he arrived home, just as the Sun was crashing and had parked hisMotorola 6800 in the main drive (he missed the 5100 bus that morning ), whenhe noticed an elegant piece of hardware escorting her daisy wheels in hisgarden. He thought to himself, "She looks user-friendly," "I'll see if she'dlike an update tonight."Mini was her name, and she was delightfull, engineered with eyes like COBOL anda Prime mainframe architecture that set Micro's peripherals networking all overthe place.

He browsed over to her casually, admiring the power of her twin 32 bit floatingpoint processors and inquired "How are you Honey Well?

." "Yes I am well," sheresponded, batting her optical fibres engagingly and smoothing her console overher curvilinear functions.

Micro settled for a straight line approximation. "I'm stand-alone tonight," hesaid, "How about computing a vector to my base address?" "I will cut out a byteto eat, and maybe we could get an offset later on."Mini ran a priority process for 2.

6 milliseconds then transmitted OK. "I'vebeen dumped myself recently, and a new page is just what I need to refresh mydisks. I'll park my machine cycle in your background and meet you inside. Shewalked off, leaving Micro admiring her solenoids and thinking, "Wow, what aglobal variable, I wonder if she'd like my firmware?

."They sat down at the process table to a top of form feed of fiche and chips anda bucket of bawdots. Mini was in conversational mode and expanded on ambiguousarguments while Micro gave occasional acknowlegments, although, in reality, hewas  analyzing the shortest and least critical path to her entry point. Hefinally settled on the old "would you like to see my benchmark subroutine?" butMini was again one step ahead.

Suddenly she was up and stripping off her parity bits to reveal the fullfunctionality of her operating software. "Let's get Basic, you RAM," she said.

Micro was loaded by this stage, but his hardware polling module had a processorof it's own and was in danger of overflowing its output buffer (a hang-up thatMicro had consulted his analyst about). "Core," was all he could say, as sheprepared to log him off.

Micro soon recovered, however, when he went down on the DEC and opened herdevice files to reveal her data set ready. He accessed his fully packed rootdevice and was about to start pushing her CPU stack, when she attempted anescape sequence .

..

."No, No" she cried, "You are not shielded."

"Reset, Baby," he replied, "I've been debugged."

"But I haven't got my current loop enabled, and I can't support childprocesses," she protested."Don't run away," he said, "I will generate an interrupt."

"No that's too error prone, and I can't abort because of my design philosophy."Micro was locked in by this stage though, and could not be turned off. But Minisoon stopped his thrashing by introducing a voltage spike into his main supply,

whereupon he fell over with a head crash and went to sleep."Computers," She thought as she compiled herself, "All they ever think of isHEX."

Millennia Year Application Software System  This memo is to announce the development of a new firm-wide software  system. We are currently building a data center that will contain all  firm data that is Year 2000 compliant. The program is referred to as  the "Millennia Year Application Software System" (MYASS).    Next Monday at 9:00 there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS  to everyone. We will continue to hold demonstrations throughout the  month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good  look at MYASS.  As for the status of the implementation of the  program, I have not addressed the networking aspects so currently only  one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed  after MYASS expands.    Several people are using the program already and have come to depend  on it. Just this morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was  not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. I've  noticed that some of the less technical personnel are somewhat afraid  of MYASS. Just last week, when asked to enter some information into  the program, I had a secretary say to me "I'm a little nervous, I've  never put anything in MYASS before." I volunteered to help her through  her first time and when we were through she admitted that it was  relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it  again. She went so far as to say that after using SAP and Oracle, she  was ready to kiss MYASS.    I know there are concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon  initial installation, but I am pleased to say the virus has been  eliminated and we were able to save MYASS.  In the future, however,  protection will be required prior to entering MYASS. We planned this  database to encompass all information associated with the business. So  as you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want  into MYASS.  As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be  commonplace to walk by an office and see a manager hand a paper to an  employee and say "Here, stick this in MYASS".  This program has  already demonstrated great benefit to the company during recent OSHA  and EPA audits. After requesting certain historical data the agency  representatives were amazed at how quickly we provided the  information. When asked how the numbers could be retrieved so rapidly  our Environmental Manager proudly stated "Simple, I just pulled them  out of MYASS."

In order to forge a cosmic accord of unprecedented unity and   harmony, The Politically Correct Movement demands that all people,   regardless of prior social preconditioning must accept the incipient   world order that will offer unlimited bliss and contentment.

C.

? PC stands for Politically Correct.  We of the Politically Correct philosophy believe in increasing a tolerance for a DIVERSITY of cultures, race, gender, ideology and alternate lifestyles.  Politically Correctness is the only social and morally acceptable outlook.  Anyone who disagrees with this philosophy is bigoted, biased, sexist, and/or closed-minded. Q:  WHY SHOULD I BE PC? Being PC is fun.  PCism is not just an attitude, it is a way of life!  PC offers the satisfaction of knowing that you are undoing the social evils of centuries of oppression. Q:  I AM A WHITE MALE.  CAN I STILL BE PC? Sure.  As a matter of fact, most people at the forefront of the PC grand destiny ARE white males.  But remember, as a white male, you must constantly feel guilty. Q:  WHY? If you are a white male, your ancestors were responsible for practically every injustice in the world--slavery, war, genocide and plaid sportscoats. That means that YOU are partially responsible for these atrocities.  Now it is time to balance the scales of justice for the descendants of those individuals whose ancestors your ancestors pushed down. Q:  HOW? It's simple.  You've got to be careful what you say, what you think, and what you do.  You just don't want to offend anyone. Q:  YOU MEAN I SHOULD GUARD AGAINST OFFENDING ANYONE? That's right.  Being offensive is destructive, and will not make the world a harmonious utopia, like in John Lennon's IMAGINE. Q:  HOW ELSE CAN I BE PC? Oh, there are lots of ways.  For example, why buy regular ice cream when you can buy "Rain Forest Crunch?"  Segrega.

.whoops.

.separate all of your garbage into different containers:  glass, metal, white paper, blue paper, plastic, etc.  Make sure that all your make-up has not been tested on animals.  Try to find at least sixty ways to use your water; when you take a shower, brush your teeth at the same time.  Then don't let the water go down the drain, use it to irrigate your lawn.  Or better yet, replace your lawn with a vegetable garden.  Don't use aerosol.  And by all means, don't burn or deface our flag.  Remember, as a citizen of the United States, your living in God's country.  If you are fortunate enough to know your ethnic heritage, dress the part!  Don't do drugs.  You should listen to at least one of the following PC musicians:  U2, REM, Sinead O'Connor, Sting, or k.

d. Lang. Harass people who wear fur coats.  Remind them that an innocent baby seal was mercilessly clubbed.  Or just yell, "FUR."  They hate that.  And don't EVER eat meat. Q:  DON'T EAT MEAT?  WHY NOT?

! Cows are animals, just like humans are animals.  That means that they have rights.  When you eat meat, you're oppressing animals! Q:  SO ALL KILLING IS BAD? No, not always.  Sometimes killing can be justified, like in the Persian Gulf.  You have to be able to tell when an animal has rights, and when it doesn't. Q:  HOW DO I KNOW WHEN AN ANIMAL HAS RIGHTS? The general rule is as follows:           IF AN ANIMAL IS RARE, PRETTY, BIG, CUTE, FURRY,              HUGGABLE, OR LOVABLE, THEN IT HAS RIGHTS. Examine the following chart:       RIGHTS                       NO RIGHTS      --------                     -----------       cows                         cockroaches       cute bunnies                 flies       dolphins in tuna nets        tuna in tuna nets       whales                       sharks       red squirrels                gray squirrels       owls                         loggers       harbor seals                 barnacles Q:  WOW.  WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO BE PC? Hug a tree.  Rejoice each day in our cultural differences, for they are what gives flavor to our great country.  Get in touch with your sexual identity. Check your refrigerator for freon leaks.  Subscribe to National Geographic. Search it for neat non-Western cultural traditions and costumes.  After you read it, use the paper as an alternative fuel source. Try to wear clothes with Xs on them if they're all natural fibers. Above all, ALWAYS question authority! Q:  BUT WAIT, I THOUGHT- Don't worry, that's not important. Q:  WELL, I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THIS. If you are feeling unsure about your motivation, just remember.  YOU ARE RIGHT.  It's that simple.  You, as a PC social warrior, are right. Q:  HOW DO I KNOW IF AN ACTION IS UN-PC? Good question.  It's important to know when someone is saying something insensitive so that you can have that person removed from society.  The guideline is as follows:      Is the confrontation between two white people?         Yes -  The liberal is right.         No  -  The white person is oppressing the ethnic person. Remember, many seemingly obvious issues, such as the railroading of Mayor Marion Barry, or the Clarence Thomas issue, are really race issues. Here's a fun practice drill for you:  See how many newspaper articles you can make into race bias stories.  It's fun!  Some PCers are so good they can make the weather report look like a KKK pamphlet! Q:  WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SEE SOMEONE DO SOMETHING NON-PC? It all depends on the situation.  If you are not in a position of authority, by all means report this activity immediately to whomever is in charge.  If your school leader, employer, or superior is hip to the trend of the 90s, she or he will take the necessary steps to have the insensitive offender disciplined. Q:  BUT ISN'T THAT CENSORSHIP? The Constitution never meant for racism, sexism and insensitivity to be espoused by anyone.  That's not what free speech is about.  Some call it censorship.  PCers call it "selective" speech.  Saying something negative about a particular race or gender is just as damaging as, say, punching them in the face.  We just can't allow that kind of verbal assault. Q:  I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT PC WORDS TO REPLACE "BLACK," "INDIAN." ETC. Yes.  That's part of the PC movement.  You see, part of the way we think about people comes directly from the words we use to describe them.  Take "black" for instance.  Why should a person be judged by the color of their skin? Q:  YOU MEAN THEY SHOULD RATHER BE JUDGED BY THE CONTENT OF THEIRCHARACTER? No, I mean they should be judged by where their ancestors are from.  If your great grandparents are from Africa, or Asia, or wherever, then you should be identified by that fact.  You can even apply for special scholarships! Q:  I'M A MIXTURE OF FRENCH, GERMAN, ENGLISH, AND RUSSIAN.  CAN I GET ONE? No, there are no scholarships for any of those.  Sorry.  If you are a woman, however, there should be some. Q:  HEY, WOULDN'T A WHITE PERSON FROM LIBYA OR EGYPT TECHNICALLY BE AN     AFRICAN-AMERICAN? Technically, yes.  But that's not the kind of African-American we mean. We mean BLACK African-Americans.  Another example:  A white South-African U.

S. immigrant is not an African-American either. Q:  HOW CAN I LEARN TO MAKE MY LANGUAGE MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT? For more help, see the PC LEXICON at the end of the handbook. Q:  I'D LIKE MY CHILD TO BE PC.  WHAT CAN I DO? Well, for one thing, we should forcibly encourage students to volunteer their time with philanthropies.  Also, we should re-emphasize non-Western perspectives on history.  Finally, we should re-structure tests and quizzes to reflect cultural biases. Q:  I DON'T GET IT. Well, the way the system works now, "select" under-represented minorities who tend to do worse on entrance tests have lower standards of admissions at school and work and receive preferential treatment.  This is unfair and wrong. Q:  IT IS? Yes.  The truly PC way to do it is to have a different grading scale for different groups which gives or subtracts points from the final score, depending on who is taking the test.  If you are white, then you have been benefited by society during your life.  That means that you lose ten to fifteen points to make the test fair to everyone else. Q:  I GUESS THAT SOUNDS RIGHT. It IS right.  That's the beauty of PC. Q:  WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF? Humor.  PC people take every comment VERY seriously.  We will not accept any comment, joke, remark, or anything that sounds like it could be a racial or ethnic slur. Q:  GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE. "What's black and white and red all over?" has been staple humor for decades.  Not PC-  It can be taken the wrong way. In every day speech, try to use phrases like, "Isn't that the pot calling the kettle African-American."  Any racial jokes or jokes even mentioning culture or gender should be omitted.  True, this mostly limits comedy to the level of sitcoms, but that's a small price to pay for social equality. Q:  IS THAT ALL THERE IS TO IT? Yes.  The Politically Correct belief is essentially a recognition that people are diversely equal.  We rejoice in this equality by treating people differently based on their equal individuality.  Hop aboard the bandwagon.

Befuddled PC Users Flood Help Lines,                       and no Question Seems to be Too Basic From the Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, March 1, 1994. Reprinted without permission AUSTIN, Texas -  The exasperated help-line caller said she couldn't gether new Dell computer to turn on.  Jay Ablinger, a Dell Computer Corp.

technician, made sure the computer was plugged in and then asked thewoman what happened when she pushed the power button. "I've pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens," thewoman replied.  "Foot pedal?" the technician asked.  "Yes," the womansaid, "this little white foot pedal with the on switch."  The "footpedal," it turned out, was the computer's mouse, a hand-operated devicethat helps to control the computer's operations.

[boring stuff deleted] Only two years ago, most calls to PC help lines came from techiesneeding help on complex problems.  But now, with computer sales to homesexploding as new "multimedia" functions gain mass appeal, PC makers saythat as many as 70% of their calls come from rank novices.  Partlybecause of the volume of calls, some computer companies have startedcharging help-line users. [boring stuff deleted] John Wolf: "A frustrated customer called, who said her brand new Conturawould not work.  She said she had unpacked the unit, plugged it in,

opened it up and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something tohappen.  When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, sheasked, 'What power switch?

'" Seemingly simple computer features baffle some users.  So many people havecalled to ask where the "any" key is when "Press Any Key" flashes on thescreen that Compaq is considering changing the command to "Press Return Key."Some people can't figure out the mouse.  Tamra Eagle, an AST technicalsupport supervisor, says one customer complained that her mouse was hardto control with the "dust cover" on.  The cover turned out to be theplastic bag the mouse was packaged in.  Dell technician Wayne Zieschangsays one of his customers held the mouse and pointed it at the screen,

all the while clicking madly.  The customer got no response because themouse works only if it's moved over a flat surface. Disk drives are another bugaboo.  Compaq technician Brent Sullivan saysa customer was having trouble reading word-processing files from hisold diskettes.  After troubleshooting for magnets and heat failed todiagnose the problem, Mr. Sullivan asked what else was being done withthe diskette.  The customer's response: "I put a label on the diskette,

roll it into the typewriter.

.." At AST, another customer dutifully complied with a technician's request thatshe send in a copy of a defective floppy disk.  A letter from the customerarrived a few days later, along with a Xerox copy of the floppy. And atDell, a technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back inthe drive and "close the door." Asking the technician to "hold on," thecustomer put the phone down and was heard walking over to shut thedoor to his room.  The technician meant the door to his floppy drive. The software inside the computer can be equally befuddling.  A Dellcustomer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything.

After 40 minutes of troubleshooting, the technician discovered the manwas trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitorscreen and hitting the "send" key. Another Dell customer needed help setting up a new program, so Dellechnician Gary Rock referred him to the local Egghead.  "Yeah, I got mecouple of friends," the customer replied.  When told Egghead was asoftware store, the man said, "Oh! I thought you meant for me to find acouple of geeks." Not realizing how fragile computers can be, some people end up damagingparts beyond repair.  A Dell customer called to complain that hiskeyboard no longer worked.  He had cleaned it, he said, filling up his       tub with soap and water and soaking his keyboard for a day, andthen removing all the keys and washing them individually. Computers make some people paranoid.  A Dell technician, Morgan Vergara, sayshe once calmed a man who became enraged because "his computer had told him hewas bad and an invalid."  Mr. Vergara patiently explained that the computer's"bad command" and "invalid" responses shouldn't be taken personally. These days PC-help technicians increasingly find themselves taking onthe role of amateur psychologists.  Mr. Shuler, the Dell technician, whoonce worked as a psychiatric nurse, says he defused a potential domesticfight by soothingly talking a man through a computer problem after theman had screamed threats at his wife and children in the background. There are also the lonely hearts who seek out human contact, even if ithappens to be a computer techie.  One man from New Hampshire calls Dellevery time he experiences a life crisis.  He gets a technician to walkhim through some contrived problem with his computer, apparently feelinguplifted by the process.

Definition of ProgrammerProgrammer:A person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumberable poundings, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.

A helicopter was flying around above Seattle yesterday when an electricalmalfunction disabled all of aircraft's electronic navigation and communicationequipment. Due to the clouds and haze the pilot could not determine hisposition or course to steer to the airport.

The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled, drew a handwrittedsign and held it in the helicopter's window.

The sign said "WHERE AM I"? in large letters.

People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a largesign an held it in a building window. The sign said, "YOU ARE IN AHELICOPTER".

The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map and determined the course to steerto SEATAC ( Seattle/Tacoma) airport and landed safely.

After they were on the ground, the co-pilot asked the pilot how the "YOU AREIN A HELICOPTER" sign helped determine their position. The pilot responded, "I knew that had to be the Microsoft building because they gave me atechnically correct but completely useless answer".

Is Windows a Virus?

No, Windows is not a virus.  Here's what viruses (viri?

) do:1. They replicate quickly -- okay, Windows does that.

2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system   as they do so -- okay, Windows does that.

3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk -- okay,   Windows does that, too.

4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable   programs and systems.  Sigh.

.. Windows does that, too.

5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too   slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware.  Yup, that's with   Windows, too.   Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental   differences:  Viruses are well supported by their authors, are   running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and   efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they   mature.

So, Windows is *not* a virus.

Microsoft Market Penetration-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-INTRODUCING CONTRACEPTIVE98 ! ! !

Microsoft Corporation has taken another step toward dominating everyaspect of American life with the introduction of Contraceptive98, asuite of applications designed for users who engage in sex. Microsofthas been a pioneer in peer-to-peer connectivity and plug and play. Itbelieves these technologies will give it substantial leverage inpenetrating the copulation enhancement market.

The product addresses two important user concerns: the need forvirus protection and the need for a firewall to ensure thenon-propagation of life.

The Contraceptive98 suite consists of three products: Condom98,

DeFetus 1.

0 (from Sementec), and AIDScan 2.

1 (from NortonUtilities). A free copy of Intercourse Explorer 4.

0 is bundled in thepackage. The suite also comes in two expanded versions.

Contraceptive98 Professional is the Client / Server edition, forprofessionals in the sexual services sector.

Contraceptive98 Small Business Edition is a package for start-ups,

aimed at the housewife and gigolo niches.

While Contraceptive98 does not address non-traditional copulatorychannels, future plug-ins are planned for next year. They will beknown as BackDoor, AuraLee, TitElation, and JerkOff.

OPERATIONOnly one node in a peer-to-peer connection needs to install thepackage. At installation, the Condom98 software checks for minimumhardware. If the user meets the requirements, the product installs andis sufficiently scaleable to meet most requirements. Afterinstallation, operation commences. One caution is that the user musthave sufficient RAM to complete the session. When the session iscomplete, a disconnect is initiated, and the user gets the message,"It is now safe to turn off your partner."DRAWBACKSUsability testers report that frequent failures were a major concernduring beta testing. General Protection Fault was the most seriouserror encountered. Early versions had numerous bugs, but most of thesehave been eliminated. The product needs to be installed each time itsused.

CONCLUSIONContraceptive98 is a robust product. Despite its drawbacks, it is areasonably good value for its $49.

95 price tag, and is far superior toits shareware version. Hopefully, future releases (of the software,

that is) will add missing functionality, such as Backout and Restore,

Uninterruptible Power Supply, and Onboard Camera (Peepy Cam).

Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is optimistic about Contraceptive98'spotential. He recently said, "Our contraceptive products will help ourcustomers do to each other what we've been doing to them for years."

A mother was teaching her three year old daughter The Lord's Prayer. For several evenings at bedtime, she repeated it after her mother. One night she said she was ready to solo. The mother listened with pride, as she carefully enunciated each word right up to the end.

.."And lead us not into temptation", she prayed, "but deliver us some e-mail, Amen."

This truck driver hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers stops   for a beer. As he approaches the bar he sees a big sign on the door   saying "NERDS NOT ALLOWED -- ENTER AT OWN RISK!" He goes in and sits   down. The bartender comes over to him, sniffs, says he smells kind of   nerdy, asks him what he does for a living. The truck driver says he   drives a truck, and the smell is just from the computers he is   hauling. The bartender says OK, truck drivers are not nerds, and   serves him a beer. As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in   with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of   pens and pencils, and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender,   without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The   truck driver asks him why he did that. The bartender said not to   worry, the nerds are overpopulating the Silicon Valley, and are in   season now. You don't even need a license, he said.   So the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and   heads back onto the freeway. Suddenly he veers to avoid an accident,   and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out   all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming,   grabbing up the computers. They are all engineers, accountants and   programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. He can't   let them steal his whole load. So remembering what happened in the   bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of   them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps   out of the car screaming at him to stop. The truck driver said,   "What's wrong? I thought nerds were in season."   "Well, sure," said the patrolman, "But you can't bait 'em."

Subject: Gullibility Virus alert (fwd)   ******************************************************************   WARNING, CAUTION, DANGER, AND BEWARE! Gullibility Virus Spreading   over the Internet!   ******************************************************************   WASHINGTON, D.

C.

--The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular   Internet Phenomena announced today that many Internet users are   becoming infected by a new virus that causes them to believe without   question every groundless story, legend, and dire warning that shows   up in their inbox or on their browser. The Gullibility Virus, as it is   called, apparently makes people believe and forward copies of silly   hoaxes relating to cookie recipes, email viruses, taxes on modems, and   get-rich-quick schemes.   "These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy lottery   tickets based on fortune cookie numbers," a spokesman said. "Most are   otherwise normal people, who would laugh at the same stories if told   to them by a stranger on a street corner." However, once these same   people become infected with the Gullibility Virus, they believe   anything they read on the Internet.   "My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone," reported   one weeping victim. "I believe every warning message and sick child   story my friends forward to me, even though most of the messages are   anonymous." Another victim, now in remission, added, "When I first   heard about Good Times, I just accepted it without question. After   all, there were dozens of other recipients on the mail header, so I   thought the virus must be true." It was a long time, the victim said,   before she could stand up at a Hoaxees Anonymous meeting and state,   "My name is Jane, and I've been hoaxed." Now, however, she is   spreading the word. "Challenge and check whatever you read," she says.   Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of the   virus, which include the following:   The willingness to believe improbable stories without thinking;   The urge to forward multiple copies of such stories to others;   A lack of desire to take three minutes to check to see if a story is   true.   D.

S. is an example of someone recently infected. He told one reporter,   "I read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost all shampoos   makes your hair fall out, so I've stopped using shampoo." When told   about the Gullibility Virus, D.

S. said he would stop reading email, so   that he would not become infected.   Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help immediately.   Experts recommend that at the first feelings of gullibility, Internet   users rush to their favorite search engine and look up the item   tempting them to thoughtless credence. Most hoaxes, legends, and tall   tales have been widely discussed and exposed by the Internet   community.   Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and there is   online help from many sources, including   2]Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Capability   3]Symantec Anti Virus Research Center   4]McAfee Associates Virus Hoax List   5]Dr. Solomons Hoax Page   6]The Urban Legends Web Site   7]Urban Legends Reference Pages   8]Datafellows Hoax Warnings   Those people who are still symptom free can help inoculate themselves   against the Gullibility Virus by reading some good material on   evaluating sources, such as   Evaluating Internet Research Sources at   http://www.

THE LIFE OF A COMPUTER ANALYST   (Long but VERY Funny!

)   Monday   ------   8:05am   User called to say they forgot password. Told them to use password   retrieval utility called FDISK. Blissfully ignorant, they thank me and   hang up. God, we let these people vote and drive, too?   8:12am   Accounting called to say they couldn't access expense reports   database. Gave them Standard Sys Admin Answer #112, "Well, it works   for me." Let them rant and rave while I unplugged my coffeemaker from   the UPS and plugged their server back in. Suggested they try it again.   One more happy customer.

..   8:14 am   User from 8:05 call said they received error message "Error accessing   Drive 0." Told them it was an OS problem. Transferred them to   microsupport.   11:00 am   Relatively quiet for last few hours. Decide to plug support phone back   in so I can call my girlfriend. Says parents are coming into town this   weekend. Put her on hold and transferred her to janitorial closet down   in basement. What is she thinking? The "Myst" and "Doom" nationals are   this weekend!   11:34 am   Another user calls (do they ever learn?

). Says they want ACL changed   on HR performance review database so that nobody but HR can access   database. Tell them no problem. Hang up. Change ACL. Add @MailSend so   performance reviews are sent to */US.   12:00 pm   Lunch   3:30 pm   Return from lunch.   3:55 pm   Wake up from nap. Bad dream makes me cranky. Bounce servers for no   reason. Return to napping.   4:23 pm   Yet another user calls. Wants to know how to change fonts on form. Ask   them what chip set they're using. Tell them to call back when they   find out.   4:55 pm   Decide to run "Create Save/Replication Conflicts" macro so next shift   has something to do.   Tuesday   -------   8:30 am   Finish reading support log from last night. Sounded busy. Terrible   time with Save/Replication conflicts.   9:00 am   Support manager arrives. Wants to discuss my attitude. Click on   PhoneNotes SmartIcon. "Love to, but kinda busy. Could you put   something in the calendar database!" I yell as I grab for the support   lines, which have (mysteriously) lit up. Walks away grumbling.   9:35 pm   Team leader from R&D needs ID for new employee. Tell them they need   form J-19R=9C9\\DARR\K1. Say they never heard of such a form. Tell   them it's in the SPECIAL FORMS database. Say they never heard of such   a database. Transfer them to janitorial closet in basement.   10:00 am   Perky sounding intern from R&D calls and says she needs new ID. Tell   her I need employee number, department name, manager name, and marital   status. Run @DbLookup against state parole board database, Centers for   Disease Control database, and my Oprah Winfrey database. No hits. Tell   her ID will be ready tonight. Drawing from the lessons learned in last   week's "Reengineering for Customer Partnership," I offer to personally   deliver ID to her apartment.   10:07 am   Janitor stops by to say he keeps getting strange calls in basement.   Offer to train him on Notes. Begin now. Let him watch console while I   grab a smoke.   1:00 pm   Return from smoking break. Janitor says phones kept ringing, so he   transferred them to cafeteria lady. I like this guy.   1:05 pm   Big commotion! Support manager falls in hole left where I pulled floor   tiles outside his office door. Stress to him importance of not running   in computer room, even if I do yell "Omigod -- Fire!"   1:15 pm   Development Standards Committee calls and complains about umlauts in   form names. Apologizing for the inconvenience, I tell them I will fix   it. Hang up and run global search/replace using gaks.   1:20 pm   Mary Hairnet from cafeteria calls. Says she keeps getting calls for   "Notice Loads" or "NoLoad Goats," she's not sure, couldn't hear over   industrial-grade blender. Tell her it was probably "Lettuce Nodes."   Maybe the food distributor with a new product? She thinks about it and   hangs up.   2:00 pm   Legal secretary calls and says she lost password. Ask her to check in   her purse, floor of car, and on bathroom counter. Tell her it probably   fell out of back of machine. Suggest she put duct tape over all the   airvents she can find on the PC. Grudgingly offer to create new ID for   her while she does that.   2:49 pm   Janitor comes back. Wants more lessons. I take off rest of day.   Wednesday   ---------   8:30 am   Irate user calls to say chipset has nothing to do with fonts on form.   Tell them of course, they should have been checking "Bitset," not   "chipset." Sheepish user apologizes and hangs up.   9:10am   Support manager, with foot in cast, returns to office. Schedules   10:00am meeting with me. User calls and wants to talk to support   manager about terrible help at support desk. Tell them manager about   to go into meeting. Sometimes life hands you material.

..   10:00 am   Call Louie in janitorial services to cover for me. Go to support   manager's office. He says he can't dismiss me but can suggest several   lateral career moves. Most involve farm implements in third-world   countries with moderate to heavy political turmoil. By and by, I ask   if he's aware of new bug which takes full-text indexed random e-mail   databases and puts all references to furry handcuffs and Bambi Boomer   in Marketing on the corporate Web page. Meeting is adjourned as he   reaches for keyboard, Web browser, and Tums.   10:30 am   Tell Louie he's doing great job. Offer to show him mainframe corporate   PBX system sometime.   11:00 am   Lunch.   4:55 pm   Return from lunch.   5:00 pm   Shift change; Going home.   Thursday   --------   8:00 am   New guy ("Marvin") started today. "Nice plaids" I offer. Show him   server room, wiring closet, and technical library. Set him up with IBM   PC-XT. Tell him to quit whining, Notes runs the same in both   monochrome and color.   8:45 am   New guy's PC finishes booting up. Tell him I'll create new ID for him.   Set minimum password length to 64. Go grab smoke.   9:30 am   Introduce Louie the custodian to Marvin. "Nice plaids" Louie comments.   Is this guy great or what?

!   11:00 am   Beat Louie in dominos game. Louie leaves. Fish spare dominos out of   sleeves ("Always have backups"). User calls, says Accounting server is   down. Untie Ethernet cable from radio antenna (better reception) and   plug back into hub. Tell user to try again. Another happy customer!   11:55 am   Brief Marvin on Corporate Policy 98.

022.

01: "Whereas all new employee   beginning on days ending in 'Y' shall enjoy all proper aspects with   said corporation, said employee is obligated to provide sustenance and   relief to senior technical analyst on shift." Marvin doubts. I point   to "Corporate Policy" database (a fine piece of work, if I say so   myself!

). "Remember, that's DOUBLE pepperoni and NO peppers!" I yell   to Marvin as he steps over open floor tile to get to exit door.   1:00 pm   Oooooh! Pizza makes me so sleepy.

..   4:30 pm   Wake from refreshing nap. Catch Marvin scanning want ads.   5:00 pm   Shift change. Flick HR's server off and on several times (just testing   the On/Off button.

..

). See ya tomorrow.   Friday   ------   8:00 am   Night shift still trying to replace power supply in HR server. Told   them it worked fine before I left.   9:00 am   Marvin still not here. Decide I might start answering these calls   myself. Unforward phones from Mailroom.   9:02 am   Yep. A user call. Users in Des Moines can't replicate. Me and the   Oiuji board determine it's sunspots. Tell them to call   Telecommunications.   9:30 am   Good God, another user! They're like ants. Says he's in San Diego and   can't replicate with Des Moines. Tell him it's sunspots, but with a   two-hour difference. Suggest he reset the time on the server back two   hours.   10:17 am   Pensacola calls. Says they can't route mail to San Diego. Tell them to   set server ahead three hours.   11:00 am   E-mail from corporate says for everybody to quit resetting the time on   their servers. I change the date stamp and forward it to Milwaukee.   11:20 am   Finish @CoffeeMake macro. Put phone back on hook.   11:23 am   Milwaukee calls, asks what day it is.   11:25 am   Support manager stops by to say Marvin called in to quit. "So hard to   get good help.

.." I respond. Support manager says he has appointment   with orthopedic doctor this afternoon, and asks if I mind sitting in   on the weekly department head meeting for him. "No problem!"   11:30 am   Call Louie and tell him opportunity knocks and he's invited to a   meeting this afternoon. "Yeah, sure. You can bring your snuff" I tell   him.   12:00 am   Lunch.   1:00 pm   Start full backups on UNIX server. Route them to device NULL to make   them fast.   1:03 pm   Full weekly backups done. Man, I love modern technology!   2:30 pm   Look in support manager's contact management database. Cancel 2:45 pm   appointment for him. He really should be at home resting, you know.   2:39 pm   New user calls. Says want to learn how to create a connection   document. Tell them to run connection document utility CTRL-ALT-DEL.   Says PC rebooted. Tell them to call microsupport.   2:50 pm   Support manager calls to say mixup at doctor's office means   appointment cancelled. Says he's just going to go on home. Ask him if   he's seen corporate Web page lately.   3:00 pm   Another (novice) user calls. Says periodic macro not working. Suggest   they place @DeleteDocument at end of formula. Promise to send them   document addendum which says so.   4:00 pm   Finish changing foreground color in all documents to white. Also set   point size to "2" in help databases.   4:30 pm   User calls to say they can't see anything in documents. Tell them to   go to view, do a "Edit -- Select All", hit delete key, and then   refresh. Promise to send them document addendum which says so.   4:45 pm   Another user calls. Says they can't read help documents. Tell them   I'll fix it. Hang up. Change font to Wingdings.   4:58 pm   Plug coffee maker into Ethernet hub to see what happens. Not (too)   much.   5:00 pm   Night shift shows up. Tell them the hub is acting funny and to have a   good weekend.

Are computers males or females? You decide.   TOP 5 REASONS WHY COMPUTERS MUST BE MALE:   5. They're heavily dependent on external tools and equipment.   4. They periodically cut you off right when you think you've   established a network connection.   3. They'll usually do what you ask them to do, but they won't do more   than they have to and they won't think of it on their own.   2. They're typically obsolete within five years and need to be traded   in for a new model. Some users, however, feel they've already invested   so much in the damn machine that they're compelled to remain with an   under powered system.   1. They get hot when you turn them on, and that's the only time you   have their attention.   FIVE REASONS COMPUTERS MUST BE FEMALE:   5. No one but their creator understands their logic.   4. Even the smallest mistakes are immediately committed to memory for   future reference.   3. The native language used to communicate with other computers is   incomprehensible to everyone else.   2. The message, "Bad command or filename," is about as informative as   "If you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to   tell you."   1. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending   half your paycheck on accessories for it.

A Synopsis of the Microsoft Car   At a recent computer expo (Comdex), Bill Gates reportedly compared the   computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept   up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be   driving $25.

00 cars that get 100 miles to the gallon." Recently,   General Motors addresses this comment by releasing this statement,   "yes, but would you want your car to crash twice a day?"   Below is a synopsis of the Microsoft Car: Every time they repainted   the lines on the road, you would have to buy a new car. Occasionally   your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just   accept this, restart and drive on. Occasionally, executing a maneuver   would cause your car to stop and fail, and you would have to   re-install the engine. for some strange reason, you would accept this   too. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you   bought "Car95" or "CarNT". But then you would have to buy more seats.   Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,   five times faster, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on 5% of   the roads. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft   upgrades for their cars, which would make their cars run much slower.   The oil, gas and alternator lights would be replaced with single   "general car fault" lights. The airbag system would say "Are you   sure?" before going off. If you were involved in a crash, you would   have no idea what happened.

ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEETS WINDOWS95   Costello: Hey, Abbott!   Abbot: Yes, Lou?   Costello: I just got my first computer.   Abbot: That's great Lou. What did you get?   Costello: A Pentium II-266, with 40 Megs of RAM, a 2.

1 Gig hard drive,   and a 24X CD-ROM.   Abbot: That's terrific, Lou.   Costello: But I don't know what any of it means!

Abbot: Well, I don't know-   Costello: Yes-sir-ee. You know your stuff. And you're going to train   me.   Abbot: Really?   Costello: Uh huh. And I am here for my first lesson.   Abbot: O.

K. Lou. What do you want to know?   Costello: I am having no problem turning it on, but I heard that you   should be very careful how you turn it off.   Abbot: That's true.   Costello: So, here I am working on my new computer and I want to turn   it off. What do I do?   Abbot: Well, first you press the Start button, and then-   Costello: No, I told you, I want to turn it off.   Abbot: I know, you press the Start button-   Costello: Wait a second. I want to turn it off. Off. I know how to   start it. So tell me what to do.   Abbot: I did.   Costello: When?   Abbot: When I told you to press the Start button.   Costello: Why should I press the Start button?   Abbot: To shut off the computer.   Costello: I press Start to stop.   Abbot: Well Start doesn't actually stop the computer.   Costello: I knew it! So what do I press.   Abbot: Start   Costello: Start what?   Abbot: Start button.   Costello: Start button to do what?   Abbot: Shut down.   Costello: You don't have to get rude!   Abbot: No, no, no! That's not what I meant.   Costello: Then say what you mean.   Abbot: To shut down the computer, press-   Costello: Don't say, "Start!"   Abbot: Then what do you want me to say?   Costello: Look, if I want to turn off the computer, I am willing to   press the Stop button, the End button and Cease and Desist button, but   no one in their right mind presses the Start to Stop.   Abbot: But that's what you do.   Costello: And you probably Go at Stop signs, and Stop at green lights.   Abbot: Don't be ridiculous.   Costello: I am being ridiculous? Well. I think it's about time we   started this conversation.   Abbot: What are you talking about?   Costello: I am starting this conversation right now. Good-bye.

IBM Memo about Peripheral Replacement   This is an actual alert to IBM Field Engineers that went out to all   IBM Branch Offices. The person who wrote it was very serious. The rest   of us may find it rather funny.   Abstract: Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit) Mouse   balls are now available as FRU. Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate   or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement.   Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse   balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.   Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the   underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than   foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ depending upon   manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the   pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced using the twist-off   method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However,   excessive handling can result in sudden discharge. Upon completion of   ball replacement, the mouse maybe used immediately.   It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for   maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and that any customer   missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these   necessary items.

A man was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess." He bent over, picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket.     The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will tell everyone how smart and brave you are and how you are my hero"  The man took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket.     The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will be your loving companion for an entire week."  The man took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket.      The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay with you for a year and do ANYTHING you want." Again the man took the frog out, smiled at it, and put it back into his pocket.      Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a year and do anything you want.  Why won't you kiss me?"      The man said, "Look, I'm a computer programmer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog is cool."

Two groups of computer experts were set up in order to findout whether computer is male or female: one group was male,

and the other group was female.

The group of women reported that computers should be refereed to as "HE" because: 1. In order to get their attention you have to turn them on. 2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 3. They are supposed to help you solve problems but half the time they are the problem. 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realise that if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a newer and better model.

The group of men reported that computers should be refered to as "SHE" because: 1. No one but the creator understands their logic. 2. The native language they use to talk to other computers is incomprehensible to anyone else. 3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for later retrieval. 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.

Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buya toaster. You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'dstill have to pay for it anyway. Toaster'95 would weigh 15000pounds (hence requiring a reinforced steel countertop), drawenough electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of thespace in your kitchen, would claim to be the first toasterthat let's you control how light or dark you want your toastto be, and would secretly interrogate your other appliances tofind out who made them. Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters,

but nonetheless would buy them since most of the good breadonly works with their toasters.
####
If Apple made toasters.

..

It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but 5 yearsearlier. The toast would make a little smiley face at you whenit popped up, or else it would get stuck and there would be alittle picture of a bomb burned onto it. If they break, thesetoasters would require a special set of MacToaster Tools toeven open up. Worldwide market share would only be 5%, but allthe bread in school lunches would be exclusively toasted onthe MacToaster.
####
Does DEC still make toasters.

..

? They made good toasters in the '70s, didn't they?
####
If Hewlett-Packard made toasters.

..

They would market the Reverse Polish Toaster,

which takes in toast and gives you regular bread.
####
If Cray made toasters.

..

They would cost $16 million but would be faster thanany other single-slice toaster in the world, at leastfor a couple of years.
####
If Wang made toasters.

..

Marketing would never agree upon what customers really wantor need in a toaster so millions of dollars would be spentin development and the toaster would be several years late.

Just after release Wang would buy another company whosetoaster ran on NT but would find that they got more ordersfor the original.

Chain Letter Type IIIHi there!

!  This chain letter has been in existence since 1897. This isabsolutely incredible because there was no email then and probably not asmany little 8 year olds writing chain letters. So this is how it works. Passthis on to 15,

067 people in the next 7 minutes or something horrible willhappen to you like:Queer Horror Story #1Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She had recentlyreceived this letter and ignored it.  She then tripped in a crack in theside walk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a drainpipe in a flood ofpoop, and went flying out over a waterfall.  Not only did she smell nasty,

she died. This Could Happen To You!

!!

Queer Horror Story #2Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and ignored it.  Later that day, he was hit by a car and so was his boyfriend (hey, somepeople swing that way, especially at Oklahoma City University).  They bothdied and went to hell. They continued to suffer in hell where they were bothcursed to eat adorable kittens every day for eternity.  This Could Happen ToYou!

!!

Remember, you could end up like Pinsley and Bip did.  Just send this letterto all of your loser friends, and everything will be Ok.

Of course, there's the guy in Peoria Illinois who DID forward this on andthen he married his secret crush, they moved to the suburbs, had 2.

3children and lived happily ever after.

Right up until he started working late every night, started an affair withhis secretary and boozing.  Then she started sleeping with the golf pro atthe local country club, became addicted to sleeping pills and their 2.

3children got into gangs and drugs. Then everything went to hell, and theygot divorced.  She got the house and the kids, and he got the car and childsupport payment, and got to keep the mortgage payment, lost his job and hiscar and now is working the midnight shift at the local McDonald's.

Chain Letter Type IVAs if you care, here is a poem that I wrote.  Send it to every one of yourfriends.

Friends- A friend is someone who is always at your side,

- A friend is someone who likes you even though you smell like a wet dog,

- A friend is someone who likes you even though you're disgustingly ugly,

- A friend is someone who cleans up for you after you've soiled yourself,

- A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry about   your loser life,

- A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really think   you should be raped by a mad goat and then thrown to vicious dogs, - Afriend is someone who scrubs your toilet and vacuums and then gets  the check and leaves and doesn't speak much English no, sorry that's    the cleaning lady,

Now pass this on! If you don't, Satan will send dogs in heat to your room inyour sleep!

!There.   Now that we've covered and dumped on the four main types of chainletters, onto the ironic part.  In order for this to get any popularity,

send it on!

!!  If you don't think it was funny at all, don't bother, butotherwise forward this sucker to everyone you know!

!  If you don't, I don'tcare.  Thanks!

Remember, the moral of the story is, if you get a chain letter, ignore it.

TRASH IT!

!!  If it's a joke or something, send it, sure! Just don't forgetto delete the chain letter part.  But if it's gonna make people feel guilty (i.

e. the willieless boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen) or nervous (i.

e.

Miranda Pinsley who ended up in a waterfall of poop), just DELETE it.

Do yourself a favor, and everyone else in the world, and say NO!

!! to BLOODY CHAIN LETTERS!

!"  Thank you.

The  Y-Zero-K Problem Translated from a recently discovered Latin scroll dated 2BC Dear Cassius:   Are you still working on the Y zero K problem?  This change from  BC to AD is giving us many headaches; there is not much time left.  I don't know how citizens will cope with working the wrong way around.  Having been working happily downwards forever, now we have to start  thinking upwards.  You would think that someone would have thought of  this earlier and not left it to us to sort it out at the last minute. I spoke to Caesar the other evening.  He was livid that Julius hadn't  done something about it when he was working out the calendar.  He said he could see why Brutus turned nasty.  We called in Consultus, but he simply said that continuing downwards using minus BC won't work and as usual charged a fortune for doing nothing useful.  Surely, we will not have to throw out all our hardware and start again?  Macrohard will make yet another fortune out of this, I suppose. The money lenders are paranoid of course!  They have been told that all  usury rates will invert, and they will have to pay their clients to take out loans.  It is an ill wind.

.. . As for myself, I just cannot see how the sand in an hourglass will flow upwards.  We have heard that there are three wise men in the East who have been working on the problem, but unfortunately they won't arrive until it's all over. I have heard that there are plans to stable all horses at midnight at the turn of the year as there are fears that they will stop and try to run backwards, causing immense damage to chariots and possible loss of  life.  Some say the world will cease to exist at the moment of  transition. Anyway, we are still continuing to work on this acursed Y zero K  problem.  I will send you a parchment if anything further develops. If you have any ideas please let me know, Plutonius Sent by Marina

Dear Tech Support:Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.

0 to Husband 1.

0 and noticed that thenew program began making unexpected changes to the accounting modules,

limiting access to flower and jewelry applications that had operatedflawlessly under Boyfriend 5.

0. In addition, Husband 1.

0 uninstalled manyother valuable programs, such as Romance 9.

9 but installed undesirableprograms such as NFL 5.

0 and NBA 3.

0. Conversation 8.

0 no longer runs andHouseCleaning 2.

6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.

3to fix these problems, but to no avail.

--Desperate***************************************Dear Desperate,

Keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.

0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.

0is an operating system. Try to enter the command: "C:/ I THOUGHT YOU LOVEDME" and install Tears 6.

2. Husband 1.

0 should then automatically run theapplications: Guilty 3.

0 and Flowers 7.

0. But remember, overuse can causeHusband 1.

0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.

5, HappyHour 7.

0 or Beer 6.

1.

Beer 6.

1 is a very bad program that will create "Snoring Loudly" wavefiles.

DO NOT install MotherInLaw 1.

0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program.

These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.

0. Insummary, Husband 1.

0 is a great program, but it does have limited memoryand cannot learn new applications quickly. Consider buying additionalsoftware to improve performance. I personally recommend HotFood 3.

0 andLingerie 5.

3.

THANK YOUThank you to all my friends who sent me such important emails this year!

It's so wonderful that you included me in your quest to inform!

Because of all of you I stopped drinking Coca-Cola after I found outfrom you that it's good for removing toilet stains and rusting thearse out of 40-gallon drum.

I stopped going to the movies for fear of sitting on a needle infectedwith a disease.

I smell like a homeless f*@k, but thank goodness I stopped usingdeodorant because you said it causes cancer.

I don't leave my car in any parking lot even though I sometimes haveto walk about seventeen blocks, because you said that someone mightdrug me with a perfume sample and then try to rob me.

I also stopped answering the phone because you said that they will askme to dial a stupid number and then I get a high phone bill withcalls to Uganda, Singapore, Tokyo and maybe the Mars Rover.

I stopped eating chicken and hamburgers because you told me they arenothing more than horrible mutant freaks with no eyes or feathers thatare bred in a lab so that places like McDonalds and KFC can sell theirwares.

I also stopped drinking anything out of a can - you said that I wouldget sick from the rat faeces and urine.

When I go to parties, I now don't mix with anybody or talk to anybody- you said that someone would take my kidneys and leave me taking a nap in a bathtub full of ice.

However, the police are also after me at present because you said notto pull over, as they could be fake policemen trying to kidnap me.

I went bankrupt from bounced checks that I wrote, in anticipation ofthe $15,

000 that Microsoft and AOL were supposed to send me when Iparticipated in their special e-mail program.

It's weird, though, that my new free cell phone never arrived, andneither did the passes for my paid vacation to Disneyland. But I ampositive that all this is because of the chain I broke or forgot tofollow and I got a curse.

Finally, a worthy pyramid scheme! Simply send this e-mail to 9 of your mates.

..

INSTRUCTIONSAnaesthetise your wife/girlfriend, put her in a large carton, (don't forgetsome ventilation holes), and send it to the person who is at the top ofyour list. Soon, your name will be at the top of the list, and you will receive 823,

542 women through the post.

Statistically, among those women, there will be at least:*       0.

5 Miss Worlds,

*       2.

5 supermodels,

*       463 wild nymphos,

*       3,

234 good-looking nymphos,

*       20,

198 who enjoy multiple orgasms,

*       and 40,

198 bi-sexual women.

In total, that is 64,

294 women who are simply hornier, less inhibited, andtastier than the miserable old cow you posted off. And, best of all, youroriginal package is guaranteed not to be one of those that come back to you.

DO NOT BREAK THIS CHAIN LETTER!

!!

One bloke for example who sent the letter to only 5 instead of 9 of hisfriends got his original bird back, still in the old dressing gown he senther off in, with the same old migraine attack, and the accusatorialexpression on her face.

On the same day, the international supermodel he'd been living with sincehe sent off his old girlfriend moved out to live with his best friend (towhom he had not sent the chain letter).

While I am sending this letter, the bloke that is in 6th place above me hasalready received 837 women and is lying in hospital suffering fromexhaustion. Outside his ward are 452 more packages.

YOU MUST BELIEVE THIS E-MAIL!

!!

This is a unique opportunity to achieve a totally satisfying sex life. Noexpensive meals out, no lengthy conversations about trivialities (that onlyinterest women) just so that you can bonk her.

No obligations, no grumpy mother-in-law, and no unpleasant  surprises likemarriage or engagement.

Do not hesitate .

.. send this letter today to 9 of your best friends.

PS. - Even if you have no girlfriend, you can send your vacuum cleaner.

PPS. - This letter can also be copied to women you know so that they canprepare themselves for the great adventure that they may soon undertake.

A missionary is sent into deepest darkest depths of Africa to live with atribe. He spends years with the people, teaching them to read, write andgood Christian values. One thing he particularly stresses is the evil ofsexual sin. ?

Thou must not commit adultery or fornication!

?One day the wife of one of the Tribe?

s noblemen gives birth to a white baby.

The village is shocked and the chief is sent by his people to talk with themissionary.

You have taught us of the evils of sexual sin, yet here a black woman givesbirth to a white child. You are the only white man who has ever set foot inour village. Anyone can see what?

s going on here!

?

The missionary replies, ?

No, no, my good man. You are mistaken. What youhave here is a natural occurrence - what is called an albino. Look to thyyonder field. See a field of white sheep, and yet amongst them is one blackone. Nature does this on occasion.

?

The chief pauses for a moment then says, ?

Tell you what, you don?

t sayanything about the sheep, I won?

t say anything about the white baby.

The beautiful secretary of the president of a bank goes on a sight-seeingtour with a very rich African king who was a very importantclient. The client out of the blue asks her to marry him. Naturally, the secretaryis quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her,

.

..don't reject the guy outright. So, she tries to think of a way todissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her.

So, after a few minutes, the woman says to the man, "I will only marry youunder three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-caratdiamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara."The African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, "Noproblem!

! I have. I have."Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, "Iwant you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, Iwant a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France."The African king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone andcalls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nodshis head and says, "Okay, okay. I build. I build." Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows thatshe'd better make this a good one. She takes her time tothink and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squintsher eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, "Since I like sex, Iwant the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis."The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and restshis elbows on the table, all the while muttering in Africandialect.

Finally, after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, lookingreally sad, and says to the woman, "Okay, okay. I cut. Icut."

Mr. Greenberg was an illiterate immigrant, but he worked hard, saved his pennies, and started a small business. It did well, and soon he had enough money to send for the wife and children. The work kept him very busy, so he never had time to learn to write, but the bank was happy to do business with him, even though his signature consisted of two X's.

He prospered, he opened more stores, the kids were transferred to private schools, the family moved into a fancy house (with one staircase going nowhere just for show).

..

you get the idea. One day his banker, Mr. Smith, asked him to drop by."So vat's the problem?" Greenberg asked, a bit anxiously.

Smith waved a bunch of checks at him. "Perhaps nothing," he said, "but I wanted to be on the safe side. These recent checks of yours are all signed with 3 X's, but your signature of record has just 2."Greenberg looked embarrassed. "I'm sorry about making trouble," he said, "but my vife said that since I'm now such a high class rich guy, I should have a middle name!"

Language Trends of the FutureThere are consistent trends in the past evolution of languages, and inall likelihood they will continue to change in the same fashion in thefuture.

In 200 years, spoken French will have only one sound, a vowel.  Allconsonants and gaps between words and sentences will disappear, leavingonly an extended "Eauuuuuuuuuuuu.

.."  Meaning will be inferred fromfacial expression.  Written French will stay exactly the same.

These consonants will not be entirely forgotten; they will migrateto Czechoslovakia, which will by that time have no use for vowels.

In 200 years, the English vocabulary will be the union of all othervocabularies, but the spelling will be original.

Similarly, the Japanese alphabet will be the union of all otheralphabets in the world.

The Cyrillic alphabet will eventually be the same as the Latinalphabet, only backwards.  A mirror will suffice for translatingRussian into Polish.

Finally, in 200 years, entire books in Germany will be one word.  Plusa verb at the end, of course.

The South Takes a Cue from Oakland Everyone is familiar with the plan to teach Ebonics in such leftist enclaves as California andMassachusetts. "Ebonics," a neologism created by combining "Ebony" and "phonics," is supposed to be the language of the untermenschen, the urban underclass.

Here in the South, we have a similar movement, called "Bubbonics!" Created from mixing "Bubba"and "phonics," we too have an entirely separate language from English. Like Ebonics, Bubbonics has a slightly different alphabet and different pronunciations from standard English. For example, the English language includes the letter "L" although Bubbonics does not. Likewise, vowel pronunciation in Bubbonics is different from English pronunciation.

Take, for example, the following sentences in English, and their translation into Bubbonics:Can I help you?

Kin ah hip ewe?

Hi, I'm Don Fowler.

Hah, ahm Dahn Fah-wah.

The discerning English speaker quickly notices that Bubbonics has fewer vowel sounds than English, and the primary vowel sound is "ah." The letters A and E are generally replaced with the sound of a short i.

For the advanced scholar, there are actually many interesting comparisons between Ebonics andBubbonics. Indeed, there have even been suggestions that Ebonics is actually a degraded form of Bubbonics, which is itself a degraded form of English. Consider the following statement inBubbonics and their counterparts in Ebonics:Ah axed ewe a quest-shun.

I axed you a question, sukka.

Ah be smaht.

I be smarts now.

Hooked ahn Bahbahnics wukks fuh me.

Hooked on 'bonics be wukking fo me.

If you're a native English speaker, and you can read the writing on the wall, then you know that your native tongue is soon to be as dead as Latin, spoken only in weird rituals or taught to kids in prep school.

And if you're a native English speaker and you CAN'T read the writing on the wall, it's probably already in Bubbonics or Ebonics, and you're just that far behind.

Gracefully surrender the things of your youth. Clean air. Tuna. Taiwan. The English language. And remember: Bilingual Education means teaching kids to be illiterate in two languages.

Late one Friday night the policeman spotted a man driving very erratically through the streets of Dublin. They pulled the man over and asked him if he had been drinking that evening."Aye, so I have. 'Tis Friday, you know, so me and the lads stopped by the pub where I had six or seven pints. And then there was something called "Happy Hour" and they served these mar-gar-itos which are quite good. I had four or five o' those. Then I had to drive me friend Mike home and O' course I had to go in for a couple of Guiness - couldn't be rude, ye know. Then I stopped on the way home to get another bottle for later .

The officer sighed, and said, "Sir, I'm afraid I'll need you to step out of the car and take a breathalyzer test."Indignantly, the man said, "Why? Don't ye believe me?

This time   he falls right into bed and is sound asleep.   He awakens the next morning to his wife standing over him shouting at   him. "So, you've been out drinking again!

After having their 11th child, an Alabama couple decided that was enough (they could not afforda larger double-wide). So, the husband went to his doctor (who also treated mules) and told himthat he and his wife/cousin didn't want to have any more children. The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (fireworks are legal in 'Bama), light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10. The Alabamian said to the doctor, "I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me." So, the couple drove to Georgia to get a second opinion. The Georgia physician was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from Alabama. This doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beercan, hold it to his ear and count to 10. Figuring that both learned physicians couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . . ", at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand.

There were three Eskimos in Alaska, and one time while they were at   their local bar, they   got to talking about how cold it was outside, and how cold their   igloos were. They could   agree on everything but whose igloo was the coldest, so they decided   to determine who,   indeed, had the coldest igloo.   They went to the first Eskimo's igloo, where he said "Watch this!" and   poured a cup of   water into the air. Well, the water froze in mid-air and fell onto the   floor solid. "Not bad"   said the other Eskimos, but each maintained their igloo was colder   still.   So they went to the second Eskimo's igloo, and he said "Watch this!"   and took a big breath   and exhaled, whereupon his breath froze into a big lump and fell to   the floor. "Wow,   that's colder than mine!"said the first Eskimo. But the third Eskimo   exclaimed his was   colder still.   So they ended up at the third Eskimo's igloo. He said "Watch this!"   and went into the   bedroom, looked under three hugh back thick furs, and retrieved one of   several small balls   of ice there. He took one of the small balls of ice and put it in a   spoon, and held a match   under it. When it heated up enough, it went "FFFAAAARRRRTTT".   He won.

"I'm from Ireland," replies the second man.   The first man responds: "You don't say, I'm from Ireland too! Let's   have another round to   Ireland."   "Of course," replies the second man.   Curious, the first man then asks: "Where in Ireland are you from?"   "Dublin," comes the reply.   "I can't believe it," says the first man. "I'm from Dublin too! Let's   have another drink to   Dublin."   "Of course," replies the second man.   Curiosity again strikes and the first man asks: "What school did you   go to?"   "Saint Mary's," replies the second man, "I graduated in '62."   "This is unbelievable!", the first man says. "I went to Saint Mary's   and I graduated in '62,   too!"   About that time in comes one of the regulars and sits down at the bar.   "What's been going   on?" he asks the bartender.   "Nothing much," replies the bartender.

Two Irish lads had been out shacking up with their girl friends. One   felt guilty and decided   he should stop at the church and confess.   He went into the confession booth and told the Father, "Father, I have   sinned. I have   committed fornication with a lady. Please forgive me."   The Father said, "Tell me who the lady was."   The lad said he couldn't do that and the Father said he couldn't grant   him forgiveness   unless he did.   "Was it Mollie O'Grady?" asked the Father."   "No."   "Was it Rosie Kelly?"   "No."   "Was it that red-headed wench Tessie O'Malley?"   "No."   "Well then," said the Father, "You'll not be forgiven."   When the lad met his friend outside the friend asked, "So, did you   find forgiveness."   "No," said the other, "but I picked up three good prospects!"

Barbara Walters was doing a documentary on the customs of American   Indians. After a   tour of a reservation, she asked a Brave,

who had only one feather in   his headdress, "Why   the difference in the number of feathers in the headdresses?" His   reply was, "Me have only   one sqaw, me have only one feather." She asked another Brave, feeling   the first fellow   was only joking. This Brave had four feathers in his headdress. He   replied, "Ugh; me   have four feathers because me sleep with four squaws." Still not   convinced the number of   feathers indicated the number of sqaws involved, she decided to   interview the Chief.   Now the Chief had a headdress full of feathers, which, needless to   say, amused Ms.   Walters. She asked the Chief, "Why do you have so many feathers in   your headdress?"   The Chief proudly pounded his chest and said, "Me Chief. Me fuck-em   all. Big, small, fat,   tall. Me fuck-em all." Horrified, Ms. Walters stated, "You ought to be   hung!" The Chief   replied, "You damned right, me hung. Big like buffalo, long like   snake." Ms. Walters   cried, "You don't have to be so goddamned hostile!" The Chief replied,   "Hoss-style, dog-   style, wolf-style, any-style, me fuck-em all!" With tears in her eyes,   Ms. Walters cried,   "Oh dear." The Chief said, "No deer. Me no fuck deer.

The headmistress at a girls' prep school in the old South   (circa 1959) calls down to the army base and speaks with one of the   officers: "We're having a social here at school and I was wondering if   you could send some of your nice young men to attend."

Here's one about the old native American who wanted a loan for $500. The banker pulled out the loan application, "What are you going to do with the money?" "Take jewlery to city and sell it," was the response. "What have you got for collateral?" "Don't know collateral." "Well that's something of value that would cover the cost of the loan.

Have you got any vehicles?" "Yes, 1949 Chevy pickup." The banker shook his head, "How about livestock?" "Yes, I have a horse." "How old is it?" "Don't know, has no teeth." Finally the banker decided to make the $500 loan. Several weeks later the old man was back in the bank. He pulled out a roll of bills, "Here to pay." he said. He then handed the banker the money to pay his loan off."What are you going to do with the rest of that money?" "Put in teepee." "Why don't you deposit it in my bank," he asked. "Don't know deposit." "You put the money in our bank and we take care of it for you. When you want to use it you can withdraw it." The old Indian leaned across the desk, "What you got for collateral?"

So it seems that these four rabbis had a series of theological arguments, and three were always in accord against the fourth. One day, the odd rabbi out, after the usual "3 to 1, majority rules" statement that signified that he had lost again, decided to appeal to a higher authority."Oh, God!" he cried. "I know in my heart that I am right and they are wrong! Please give me a sign to prove it to them!"It was a beautiful, sunny day. As soon as the rabbi finished his prayer, a storm cloud moved across the sky above the four. It rumbled once and dissolved. "A sign from God! See, I'm right, I knew it!" But the other three disagreed, pointing out that storm clouds form on hot days.

So the rabbi prayed again: "Oh, God, I need a bigger sign to show that I am right and they are wrong. So please, God, a bigger sign!"  This time four storm clouds appeared, rushed toward each other to form one big cloud, and a bolt of lightning slammed into a tree on a nearby hill."I told you I was right!" cried the rabbi, but his friends insisted that nothing had happened that could not be explained by natural causes.

The rabbi was getting ready to ask for a *very big* sign, but just as he said, "Oh God.

..

," the sky turned pitch black, the earth shook, and a deep, booming voice intoned, "HEEEEEEEE'S RIIIIIIIGHT!"The rabbi put his hands on his hips, turned to the other three, and said, "Well?"

"So," shrugged one of the other rabbis, "now it's 3 to 2."

A town in Poland had only one cow and it stopped giving milk. The townspeople did a little research and discovered they could get a cow from Moscow for 2000 rubles - or one from Minsk for only 1000 rubles. So, naturally, --- they got the cow from Minsk.

It was a great cow: had a wonderful disposition, and gave lots of milk and lots of cream. Everybody loved it dearly. The people decided they would mate the cow and get more cows like it, and then they would never have to worry about their milk supply again.

So they got a bull and led the cow and the bull into the pasture. When the bull came in from the right to mount the cow, the cow moved to the left. When the bull moved in to mount the cow from the left, the cow moved to the right. This went on all day.

Finally, in desperation, the people decided to go ask the rabbi what to do. After all he was very wise.

They told him the story. "Rabbi, we've tried all day to mate our cow. When the bull moves in from the right the cow moves left and when the bull moves in from the left the cow moves to the right. What do we do?"The Rabbi thought a moment and asked, "Did you buy this cow from Minsk?"

"Rabbi!" they replied as one, "You are so wise! We never said we bought the cow from Minsk. How did you know that?"The Rabbi said, sadly, "My wife is from Minsk."

A pious man who had reached the age of 105 suddenly stopped going to synagogue. Alarmed by the old fellow's absence after so many years of faithful attendance the Rabbi went to see him. He found him in excellent health, so the Rabbi asked, "How come after all these years we don't see you at services anymore?"The old man looked around and lowered his voice. "I'll tell you, Rabbi," he whispered. "When I got to be 90, I expected God to take me any day. But then I got to be 95, then 100, then 105. So I figured that God is very busy and must've forgotten about me, and I don't want to remind Him!"

Early one morning, the wife, drowsy from bed, went to the toiletfor the morning's relief, and neglected to notice that the seat was up.

When she sat, she kept going!

She was just the right size and shape so that she became jammedinto the toilet past her waist with her legs sticking straight up infront of her.

She cried for her husband, who rushed in, and for the next hour trieddesperately to extricate her.

In this process they removed her sleeping gown, but this only left hernaked and still stuck, with a particular part of her anatomy prominentlyvisible between her splayed legs.

despite the embarrassing nature of their problem.

The plumber walked into the bathroom, took one long look, and commented:"Well, I think I can save your wife, buddy, but the Rabbi's a goner."

ARKANSAS MOTHER WRITES HER SONDearest Redneck Son,        I'm writing this slow because I know you can't read fast.  We don't live where we did when you left home.  Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from your home, so we moved.        I won't be able to send you the address because the last Arkansas family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so that they wouldn't have to change their address.        This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though.  Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain.

..

we haven't seen them since.        The weather isn't bad here.  It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days.        About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.        John locked his keys in the car yesterday.  We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.        Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you're an aunt or an uncle.

The baby looks just like your brother.        Uncle Ted fell in a whisky vat last week.  Some men triedto pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drpwmed.

We had him cremated and he burned for three days.        Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck.  Ralph was driving.  He rolled down the window and swam  to safety.  Your other two friends were in back.  They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down.        There isn't much more news at this time.  Nothing much out of the normal has happened.                                        Love,   Mom

When they finally reach a fine stand of trees, Shaun brushes off the first tree, and stands back with Paddy to look at it. "Well, Paddy, What do you think?"

"Sorry, Shaun, this tree won't do. Let's try another one". They come upon another nice tree, Shaun brushes it off, and they both look at it. "How about this one, Paddy?" "Not quite, Shaun. Let's keep looking".

This goes on until nightfall. Both Paddy and Shaun are cold, tired, and hungry. "Well, Paddy, what do we do now?" "Shaun, I think we should take home the next tree we find, whether it has lights on it or not.

So that night he did and God replied, "You are what you are." The next day he said to the other zebra, "I still don't understand what I am because God just said, You are what you are."

An older Jewish gentleman marries a younger lady and they are very much in love. However, no matter what the husband does sexually, the woman never achieves orgasm. Since a Jewish wife is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to ask the rabbi. The rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion."Hire a strapping young man. While the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel over you. That will help the wife fantasize and should bring on an orgasm."They go home and follow the rabbi's advice. They hire a handsome young man and he waves a towel over them as they make love. But it doesn't help and she is still unsatisfied.  Perplexed, they go back to the rabbi."Okay", says the rabbi, "let's try it reversed. Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them."Once again, they follow the rabbi's advice. The young man gets into bed with the wife and the husband waves the towel.  The young man gets to work with great enthusiasm and the wife soon has an enormous, room-shaking screaming orgasm.

The husband smiles, looks at the young man and says to him triumphantly,  "You see, THAT'S the way to wave a towel!"

Continuing the current trend of large-scale mergers and acquisitions, itwas announced today at a press conference that Christmas and Hanukkah willmerge.

An industry source said that the deal had been in the works about 1300 years.

While details were not available at press time, it is believed that theoverhead cost of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Hanukkah was becoming prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're told, the world will be able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the Fifteen Days of Chrismukah, as the new holiday is being called.

Massive layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milkingbeing the hardest hit.

As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the dreydl,

currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming unintelligible to a wider audience.

Also, instead of translating to "A great miracle happened there," themessage on the dreydl will be the more generic "Miraculous stuff happens."In exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Clausand his vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts.

One of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least threehundred years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk and cookies for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. Abreakthrough came last year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher. All sides appeared happy about this.

Fortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to maintain thecompetitive balance. He then closed the press conference by leading allpresent in a rousing rendition of "Oy Vey, All Ye Faithful."

Old Mrs. Goldfarb, aged 96, stands and announces,"If the rabbi stays, I offer SEX!

!"There is a hush.  The rabbi, blushing, asks, "Mrs. Goldfarb,

whatever possessed you to say that?"Mrs. Goldfarb answers, "I just asked Mr. Goldfarb what wecould contribute to make the rabbi stay.  Mr. Goldfarb said,

'Fuck the rabbi.

A man wonders if having sex on the Sabbath is a sin because he is not sure if sex is work or play. So he goes to a priest and asks for his opinion on this question. After consulting the Bible, the priest says, "My son, after an exhaustive search, I am positive that sex is work and is therefore not permitted on Sundays." The man thinks: "What does a priest know about sex?" So he goes to a minister who, after all, is a married man and experienced in this matter. He queries the minister and receives the same reply. Sex is work and therefore not for the Sabbath! Not pleased with the reply, he seeks out a Rabbi, a man of thousands of years tradition and knowledge. The Rabbi ponders the question, then states, "My son, sex is definitely play." The man replies, "Rabbi, how can you be so sure when so many others tell me sex is work?" The Rabbi softly speaks, "My son, if sex were work, my wife would have the maid do it." Sent by Jesse

Long, but pretty good:On a group of beautiful deserted islands in the middle of nowhere, the following people are suddenly stranded by, as you might expect, a shipwreck: 2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman 2 French men and 1 French woman 2 German men and 1 German woman 2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman 2 English men and 1 English woman 2 Bulgarian men and 1 Bulgarian woman 2 Japanese men and 1 Japanese woman 2 Chinese men and 1 Chinese woman 2 American men and 1 American woman 2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman One month later on these same absolutely stunning deserted islands in the middle of nowhere, the following things have occurred .

.. One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman. The two French men and the French woman are living happily together in a menage-a-trois. The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of alternating visits with the German woman The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them. The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. The two Bulgarian men took one long look at the endless ocean, another long look at the Bulgarian woman, and started swimming. The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are awaiting instructions. The two Chinese men have set up a pharmacy, a liquor store, a restaurant and a laundry, and have got the woman pregnant in order to supply employees for their stores. The two American men are contemplating the virtues of suicide because the American woman endlessly complains about her body; the true nature of feminism; how she can do everything they can do; the necessity of fulfillment; the equal division of household chores; how sand and palm trees make her arse look fat; how her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her nicer than they do; how her relationship with her mother is improving and how at least the taxes are low and it isn't raining. The two Irish men have divided the island into North and South and setup a distillery. They don't remember if sex is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after the first few liters of coconut whisky. But they're satisfied because at least the English aren't having any fun.

After months of negotiation with the authorities, aTalmudist from Odessa was granted permission to visitMoscow. He boarded the train and found an empty seat.

At the next stop a young man got on and sat next tohim. The scholar looked at the young man and thought:This fellow doesn't look like a peasant, and if heisn't a peasant he probably comes from this district.

If he comes from this district, then he must be Jewishbecause this is, after all, a Jewish district. On theother hand, if he is a Jew, where could he be going?

I'm the only Jew in our district who has permission totravel to Moscow. Ahh? But just outside Moscow thereis a little village called Samvet, and Jews don't needspecial permission to go there. But why would he begoing to Samvet? He's probably going to visit one ofthe Jewish families there, but how many Jewishfamilies are there in Samvet? Only two - theBernsteins and the Steinbergs. The Bernsteins are aterrible family, and a nice looking fellow like himmust be visiting the Steinbergs. But why is he going?

The Steinbergs have only daughters, so maybe he'stheir son-in-law. But if he is, then which daughterdid he marry? They say that Sarah married a nicelawyer from Budapest, and Esther married a businessmanfrom Zhitomer, so it must be Sarah's husband. Whichmeans that his name is Alexander Cohen, if I'm notmistaken. But if he comes from Budapest, with all theanti-Semitism they have there, he must have changedhis name. What's the Hungarian equivalent of Cohen?

Kovacs. But if they allowed him to change his name, hemust have some special status. What could it be? Adoctorate from the University for sure. At this pointthe scholar turns to the young man and says, "How doyou do, Dr. Kovacs?" "Very well, thank you, sir." answered the startledpassenger. But how is it that you know my name?" "Oh," replied the Talmudist, "it was obvious."

A man goes to his doctor for his annual physical complaining of all kinds of mysterious ailments -- lack of sleep, no drive, verylittle appetite, nervous, etc. After a complete exam, the doctor can find nothing physically wrong and suspects the man issuffering from depression. The two had been friends for many years, so the doctor did not hesitate to ask the man about hispersonal life."Well, if you must know," said the patient, "I cannot stand my wife. She's made my life unbearable. I fantasize allthe time about killing that damn witch. In fact, if you are truly my friend, you'll give me some kind of untraceablepoison to give her, so I may end my misery."The doctor explained that not only was that illegal, it would in fact, violate his oath to save lives. He said, "Besides, you'll getlife in prison yourself, at best. I'll tell ya what though, I can give you this powerful aphrodisiac to slip into hercoffee. You can then 'love her to death'. No jury in the world is going to convict a man for loving his wife toomuch. She'll be gone in a month at best."The man blessed the doctor, went home and started putting the love elixir in his wife's coffee the very next morning. Threeweeks later, the doctor hasn't heard a word from his friend, and becomes concerned. After office hours, he stops by his friend'shouse to see if all is well. He finds his friend sitting on the sun deck, wrapped in a blanket, even though it's a warm Spring day.

The man's face was gaunt and pale, he'd lost Lord knows how much weight,

and looked terrible. The doctor asked, "Whatthe Hell happened ?

??"The man said, "I followed your advice to the letter. That woman and I made love like a pair of crazed rabbits, dayand nite." Then, he chuckled, causing a terrible wheeze. Just then the wife appeared from inside the house. All slim and trimand dressed in tennis clothes; smiling, she said she was off for a few sets of tennis. As she leaped into her new sports car, herhusband cackled and said to the doctor, "Look at that dumb crazy bitch. She hasn't a lick of sense. If she only knewshe has less than a week to live she wouldn't be so God damn frisky."

On   your way home from my office stop at the grocery store and buy some   grapes and some doughnuts."      "Go home, take off your clothes, and you, sir, roll the grapes across   the floor until you make a bulls eye in your wife's 'love canal'.   Then, on hands and knees you must crawl to her like a leopard and   retrieve the grape using only your tongue."      "Then next, ma'am, you must take the doughnuts and from across the   room, toss them at your husband until you make a ringer around his   'love pole'. Then, like a lioness, you must crawl to him and consume   the doughnut."      The couple went home and their sex life became more and more   wonderful.

I believe your sex life is as good as it will   ever be. I cannot help."      The Greens pleaded with him, and said, "You helped our friends the   Browns, now please, please help us."      "Well, all right", the doctor said. "On your way home from the office,   stop at the grocery store and buy some apples and a box of   Cheerios.

Did you know that once you get married,           you can look forward to three different kinds of sex?                                         First, there's House Sex:          That's when you make love all over the house: on the floor, on          the kitchen table, in the garage, anywhere, anytime -- much          like two crazed rabbits.             Then comes Bedroom Sex:          That's when the kids are finally fed, bathed and asleep; the          curtains closed; nothing much on TV; and the door locked -- you          make love in the bedroom.             Last comes Hall Sex:          That's when you pass each other in the hall and snarl -- "Screw          You !"

How to be a Good WifeExcerpted from a 1950's high school home economics textbookHave dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal--on time. This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs. Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospect of a good meal is part of the warm welcome needed.

Prepare yourself. Take fifteen minutes to rest so that you'll be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your makeup, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring day may need a life.

Clear away the clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up the school books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give you a lift, too.

Prepare the children. Take a few minutes to wash the children's hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if necessary, change their clothes. They are little treasures and he would like to see them playing the part.

Minimize all noise. At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of the washer, dryer, dishwasher, or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to be quiet. Be happy to see him; greet him with a smile and be glad to see him.

Some don'ts: Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't complain if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared with what he might have gone through that day. Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest he lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a low, soft, soothing, and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax and unwind.

Listen to him. You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first.

Make the evening his: Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner or to other places of entertainment. Instead, try to understand his world of strain and pressure, his need to be home and relax.

Your goal: Try to make your home a place of peace and order where your husband can renew himself in body and spirit.

These are a delicate shade, butthe lady I bought them from showed me a pair that she had worn for threeweeks and they were hardly soiled.  I had the sales girl try them on andshe really looked smart.  I wish I could put them on you the first time.

No doubt, other men's hands will come in contact with them before I havethe chance to see you again.  When you take them off blow in them beforeputting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.

Be sure to keep them on when you clean them or they might shrink.  I hopeyou like them and will wear them for me next Friday night.                                                           All My Love,                                           JimmyP.

S.  Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year.      Also, the sales girl showed me how they look when worn in the      latest style - folded down with the fur showing.

The eighty-eight-year-old millionaire married an eighteen-year-old country girl.  He was quite content, but after a few weeks she told him that she was going to leave him if she didn't get some loving real soon. He had his chauffeured limousine take him to a high-priced specialist who studied him and then gave him a shot of spermatozoa. "Now look," the doctor said, "the only way you're going to get it up is to say "beep," and then to get it soft again, you say, "beep, beep."

"How marvelous," the old man said."Yes, but I must warn you," the doctor said," it's only going to work three times before you die."On his way home, the man decided he wasn't going to live through three of them anyway, so he decided to waste one trying it out. "Beep!" he said. Immediately he was UP. Satisfied, he said, "beep, beep," and he was down again.  He chuckled with delight and anticipation. At that moment, a little yellow Volkswagen pulled past his limousine and went "beep," and the car in the opposite lane responded with "beep beep." Alert to his jeopardy, the old man instructed his chauffeur to "speed it up."  He raced into the house as fast as he could for his last great lay.  "Honey," he shouted at her, "don't ask questions.  Just drop your clothes and hope into bed." Caught up in his excitement, she did.  He undressed nervously and hurried in after her.  Just as he was climbing into bed, he said, "beep," and he was UP.

He was just starting to enter his young wife when she said,

, "What's all this "beep beep" shit?"

Tonight, Darling, you and I are going to make love like you've never had before, wild, passionate sex.

..

.you'll love it!"Doris thinks for a minute and says, "I don't know, Sol. I've heard about active sex and heart conditions. I don't want it to be on my head if you croak while we are making love. Maybe, just maybe, if your doctor wrote a note to me saying that everything was OK.

.. maybe I would have such sex with you.

Noah And Today's ArkThe Lord spoke to Noah and said, "Noah, in six months I am goingto make it rain until the whole world is covered with water andall the evil things are destroyed. But, I want to save a few goodpeople and two of every living thing on the planet. I am orderingyou to build an ark." And, in a flash of lightning, he deliveredthe specifications for the ark."OK," Noah said, trembling with fear and fumbling with theblueprints, "I'm your man."

"Six months and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord. "Youbetter have my ark completed or learn to swim for a long, longtime!"Six months passed, the sky began to cloud up, and the rain beganto fall in torrents. The Lord looked down and saw Noah sitting inhis yard, weeping, and there was no ark."Noah!" shouted the Lord, "where is My ark?" A lightning boltcrashed into the ground right beside Noah."Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah. "I did my best, but therewere some big problems. First, I had to get a building permit forthe ark's construction, but your plans did not meet their code.

So, I had to hire an engineer to redo the plans, only to get intoa long argument with him about whether to include afire-sprinkler system."

"My neighbors objected, claiming that I was violating zoningordinances by building the ark in my front yard, so I had to geta variance from the city planning board."

"Then, I had a big problem getting enough wood for the ark,

because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl.

I tried to convince the environmentalists and the U.

S. Fish andWildlife Service that I needed the wood to save the owls, butthey wouldn't let me catch them, so no owls."

"Next, I started gathering up the animals but got sued by ananimal rights group that objected to me taking along only two ofeach kind."

"Just when the suit got dismissed, the EPA notified me that Icouldn't complete the ark without filing an environmental impactstatement on your proposed flood.  They didn't take kindly to theidea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a SupremeBeing."

"Then, the Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed floodplan. I sent them a globe!"

"Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with theEqual Opportunities Commission over how many minorities I'msupposed to hire."

"The IRS has seized all my assets claiming that I am trying toleave the country, and I just got a notice from the state that Iowe some kind of use tax. Really, I don't think I can finish theark in less than five years."With that, the sky cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbowarched across the sky.

Noah looked up and smiled. "You mean you are not going to destroythe world?" he asked hopefully."No," said the Lord, "the government already has."

He caught asupply boat to a supply base in the south of England, then caught atrain to London. The train was extremely crowded and he could not finda seat.

Finally he found a compartment with seats facing each other; there wasroom for two people on each seat. On one side sat only a proper looking,

older British lady, with a small dog sitting in the empty seat beside her."Could I please sit in that seat?" he asked.

The lady was insulted. "You bloody Americans are so rude", she said,"can't you see my dog is sitting there"?

He walked through the train once more and still could not find a seat.

He found himself back at the same place."Lady I love dogs - have a couple at home - so I would be glad to holdyour dog if I can sit down", he said.

The lady replied, "You Americans are not only rude you are arrogant".

He leaned against the wall for a time, but was so tired he finallysaid,"Lady, I've been on the front lines in Europe for three months withnot a decent rest for all that time. Could I please sit there and hold yourdog?"The lady replied, "You Americans are not only rude and arrogant, youare also obnoxious."With that comment, the soldier calmly stepped in, picked up the dog,

threw it out the window, and sat down.

The lady was speechless.

An older, neatly dressed Englishman sitting across on the other seatspoke up. "Young man, I do not know if all you Americans fit thelady's description of you or not.

A fellow has a week off and decides to play a round of golf every day. First thing Monday morning, he sets off on his first round and soon catches up to the person in front. He sees that this is a woman and, as he catches up to her on a par 3, that, in fact, she's very attractive. He's interested and suggests that they play the rest of the round together. She agrees and a very close match ensues. She turns out also to be a very talented golferand she wins their little competition on the last hole.

He congratulates her in the car park then offers to give her a lift when he sees she doesn't have a car. All in all it's been a highly enjoyable morning.

On the way to her place, she thanks him for the morning's company and competition and says she hasn't enjoyed herself so much on the course for a long time. "In fact," she says, "I'd like you to pull over so I can show you how much I appreciated everything." He pulls over, they kiss and she shows him her appreciation.

.. The next morning he spies her at the first tee and suggests they play together again. He's actually quite competitive and slightly peeved that she beat him the previous day. Again they have a magnificent day, enjoying each other's company and playing a tight, competitive round of golf. Again she pips him at the last, again he drives her home and again she shows her appreciation.

This goes on all week, with her beating him narrowly every day. This is a sore point for his male ego but, nevertheless, in the car home from their Friday afternoon round, he tells her that he has had such a fine week that he has a surprise planned: dinner for two at a fancy candle-lit restaurant followed by a night of passion in the penthouse apartment of a posh hotel. Surprisingly, she bursts into tears and says she can't agree to this. He can't work out what the fuss is about but eventually she admits the reason."You see," she tearfully sobs, "I'm a transvestite."He is aghast. He swerves violently off the road, pulls the car to a screeching halt and curses madly, overcome with emotion. "I'm sorry," she repeats."You bastard," he screams, red in the face, "You cheating bastard. You've been playing off the red tees all week!

An old sailing ship is becalmed at sea with a full complement of sailors. They are stuck there for days and days with nothing to do. One morning the captain decides he is going to lay on some entertainment for the men. He orders a barrel to be placed on the top deck. It has an orifice in the side and he invites each one of the men to "take the pleasures" of the barrel to their heart's content. Soon a full-fledged hedonistic orgy is underway. The men are cheerful once again and morale is boosted. Things reach such a frenzy that even the captain's dog has a go. Once the party is over and the barrel is full of the team's spirit, it is bunged up and thrown overboard. The ship sails away. A few days later the barrel comes ashore on the beach of a deserted island in the middle of nowhere. The only inhabitants of the island are the nuns who have founded their convent there. The nuns find the barrel and open it. They don't recognize the contents and take it to be wax, from which they fashion candles. Of course, nuns being nuns, they use the candles in the way only nuns can. Nine months later an inordinate number of babies appear inexplicably on the island. One of the nuns is very guilty about her sins and approaches the Mother Superior for confession. "Forgive me, Mother. I have had a baby." The Mother Superior says, "That's nothing, my child.

The Young Man's Big Mouth   A young man goes into a drug store to buy condoms. The pharmacist says   the condoms   come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants.   "Well," he said, "I've   been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot. I want the   condoms because I think   tonight's "the" night. We're having dinner with her parents, and then   we're going out. And   I've got a feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that. Once she's had me,   she'll want me all the   time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack." The young man makes his   purchaseand leaves.   Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her   parents. He asks if he   might give the blessing, and they agree. He begins the prayer, but   continues praying for   several minutes. The girl leans over and says, "You never told me that   you were such a   religious person."

The Pilots One day at a busy airport, the passengers on a   commercial airliner are seated, waiting for the cockpit crew to show   up so they can get under way. The pilot and co pilot finally appear in   the rear of the plane, and begin walking up to the cockpit through the   center aisle. Both appear to be blind. The pilot is using a white   cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the   aisle, and the co pilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes   covered with huge sunglasses.   At first the passengers do not react; thinking that it must be some   sort of practical joke. However, after a few minutes the engines start   spooling up and the airplane starts moving down the runway. The   passengers look at each other with some uneasiness, whispering among   themselves and looking desperately to the stewardesses for   reassurance.   Then the airplane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin   panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer   and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and   more hysterical.   Finally, when the airplane has less than 20 feet of runway left, there   is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at   once, and at the very last moment the airplane lifts off and is   airborne.   Up in the cockpit, the co pilot breathes a sigh of relief and turns to   the Captain: "You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going   to scream, and we're gonna get killed!"

A man is walking along one day and he comes upon a ladder.   Looking up, he sees that the ladder disappears into the clouds.   Curious, he begins to climb. Before long, he is *in* the clouds. He   looks around and sees the most horribly ugly woman he has ever seen in   his life.   Obese, snaggle-toothed, matted hair.

..

.. She looks at him, beckons,   and says, "Have sex with me, or climb the ladder to success."   Well, having no intention of doing *anything* with this woman, the man   climbs higher up the ladder. A bit further on, he comes upon a woman   slightly less ugly than the woman before. Not attractive, by any   means, but not repugnant. "Have sex with me, or climb the ladder to   success, "she says.   Again, the man elects to continue his climb.   Before long, he comes upon another woman. This one is actually   attractive. Not a knock-out, but very pleasing. "Have sex with me, or   climb the ladder to success."   Well, he figures the women keep getting better and better looking as   he gets higher and higher. So he decides to continue climbing.   A bit farther up is the most gorgeous woman he's ever seen in his   life! Miss America beautiful. In a sultry voice she says, "Have sex   with me, or climb the ladder to success." Well, needless to say he is   *very* tempted.   But he just can't imagine what could top this woman, so he decides to   climb higher.   On the next cloud up is a horrid 500 lb man. You can see the lice in   his hair, he stinks, his clothes are ratty.

..

.. "Who are you?" our   climber asks in horror. Grinning a toothless grin, the man looks at   him and says, "Hi. I'm Cess.

Embarrassing moments The following are the top three   winners of a Most Embarrassing Moments Contest in New Woman Magazine.   1)"While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to   release some pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab   hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other   patrons. I told her that if she did not start behaving *right now*,   she would be punished. To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said   in a voice just as threatening, 'If you don't let me go right now, I   will tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!

'   "The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the   tellers stopped what they were doing! I mustered up the last of my   dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last   thing I heard when the door closed behind me were screams of laughter"   * Amy Richardson; Stafford,

Virginia   2)"It was the day before my eighteenth birthday. I was living at home,   but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my   girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. "As we lay in bed after   making love, we heard the telephone ring downstairs. I suggested to my   girlfriend that I give her a piggyback ride to the phone. Since we   didn't want to miss the call, we didn't have time to get dressed. When   we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights suddenly came on and a   whole crowd of people yelled, 'SURPRISE!

' My entire family - aunts,   uncles, Grandparents, cousins and all my friends were standing there!   My girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of shock and embarrassment   for what seemed like an eternity. "Since then, no one in my family has   planned a surprise party again." * Tim Cahill; Poughkeepsie, New York   3)A lady who picked up several items at a discount store. When she   finally got up to the checker, she learned that one of her items had   no price tag. Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on the   intercom and boomed out for all the store to hear: "PRICE CHECK ON   LANE THIRTEEN,

TAMPAX, SUPERSIZE." That was bad enough, but somebody at   the rear of the store apparently misunderstood the word "tampax" for   "THUMBTACKS." In a business-like tone, a voice boomed back over the   intercom: "DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE   KIND YOU POUND IN WITH A HAMMER?"

My penis made me locally famous. I didn't find out about it until I got tothe University. Before then my experience with women was non-existent. I'dbeen at a boys' school, and anyway I was pretty spotty. I couldn't believewhen, all of a sudden, at the Freshman Ball, I was snuggling. I was evenmore amazed when we were in her room. We were both wasted. I didn't have aclue how to behave, I was terrified, but she knew what to do and in no time we were naked, in bed. She was kissing my mouth. My neck. My chest, my stomach, my.

..

.-- She stopped."Oh my goodness!" she said, incredulous, "Your cock tastes just likeCHOCOLATE!"Melanie (her name) wasn't a shy girl. She must have told her friend Suzy. I realized this the next day when a very attractive girl, with hip clothes and trainers, approached me in the Union Bar and just started chatting. This had NEVER happened to me before. She asked me if I wanted to hear a new CD she'd bought, and then we were in her room. Halfway through the second track we were naked. She'd hardly even kissed me before her face disappeared under the duvet."It does!", she exclaimed suddenly. "It bloody well DOES!

!"Two weeks into college I was still a virgin. I had, however, received twenty three blowjobs from twelve different girls and heard words such as'incredible', 'amazing', `Bournville', 'Swiss' and 'Belgian' exclaimed bymops of hair beneath my bedclothes. I had also been requested to immersemyself in a glass of milk and move vigorously to see if any of the flavorrubbed off. It didn't.

I went to the Doctor. She didn't believe me. Nor did she try it out, which I thought shockingly unscientific. But she did see the state I was in and gave me a salve.

Okay, so I'll admit it. For the first year it was great. I could have loads of women, any time I wanted. I got cunning and made them sleep with me first. I got fussy. All the guys on campus were jealous. People who didn't know me looked wide eyed to see one or more stunning girls on the arm of a spotty, pale youth, with lank dark hair and glasses. "What's he got?", they seemed to ask themselves.

When the second year came I got really tired of it. There was a whole newyear of girls who wanted to try me out. I felt like an object. A specimen.

And there was something missing from my life, a yearning. I tried to haveconversations with girls, in the coffee bar say, but all the time their eyes would be flicking to my crotch. Their tongues would run over their lips, their eyes would glaze over. I would make a hasty excuse and leave. It was about this time I began to get really upset about it. Everyone had started calling me Hob Nob.

When I say "everyone", it's not quite true: Some people called me WillyWonka.

Hey, it is NOT funny! I was a person! I was more than a sexual organ thatjust happened to be flavored like confectionery. Everyone stared at me. All the girls laughed when they saw me. I overheard them talking about me. About it! I think I had a bit of a breakdown, I couldn't take it. All through my third year I stayed in. I saw no one.

I had given up on my little University world. Everyone knew everything.

Because I didn't have anything to do I studied all the time. I did well and then I went to New York, Columbia, for a Masters. I took a deep breath of fresh air. Fantastic!

It was great! Nobody knew me! If it hadn't been for the lousy beer it would have been perfect. I met Laurie a few months later and we started to go out.

I'd seen her around in the cafeteria on campus, but it was only when I heard her give a paper on radical feminism that I really noticed her. She wrote about the politics of oral sex. She stood at the lectern in black jeans, white tee shirt, her hair tied back severely, her little fists clenching to emphasize a point."Oral sex", she had concluded, "is degrading. The worship of the phallusonly serves to enforce the enslavement of women. No woman should ever do it, and I certainly won't do it ever again. Ever. Thank you."She stepped down from the platform to rapturous applause from a room mainly filled by women. I was enraptured, entranced. I had to get to know her.

Well, eventually we got it together. Having no chocolate penis to rely on, I had to be myself and for a long time she wasn't interested. But then it all happened. Nights discussing politics, poetry, walks in the park, old Cocteau movies. Love, smooth and slow, calm as an angel. About a year after we met, she was lying in my bed, naked, her black hair blooming like an impossible rose against my sheets, her flawless skin almost as white as they were. I was so happy. I started to kiss her, to cover her with kisses. I wanted to adore her, to make her feel better than anything; sighs escaped her like wind from a wood across a wheat field.

.."No!" she said.

She took me by the scruff of the neck. "Not there!"I stopped."Why not?", I asked."I knew it", she said firmly. "I won't do it to you in return. I won't.

Not.

.."

"I know," I assured her. "I *want* to do it to you. But I don't want you to do it to me, ever."

"You will", she said, "You will! I knew this would happen.

.."I didn't listen to her. I knew. There was no way I'd let her even if shewanted to. Never. I covered the insides of her thighs with my face andrested my hands on the tops of her legs. I pushed them apart slightly. Sheresisted a little but then she opened her legs wider and I --I lifted my head up."Guinness!" I cried, "Guinness!

!"

There was an old married couple that had happily lived   together for nearly forty years. The only friction in their marriage   was caused by the husband's habit of breaking wind nearly every   morning as he awoke. The noise would always wake up his wife and the   smell would cause her eyes to water as she would choke and gasp for   air. Nearly every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping one   in the morning. He told her that the couldn't help it. She begged him   to see a doctor to see if anything could be done but the husband   wouldn't hear of it. He told her that it was just a natural bodily   function and then he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the   fumes away with her hands. She told him that there was nothing natural   about it and if he didn't stop, he was one day going to "fart his guts   out".   The years went by and the wife continued to suffer and the husband   continued to ignore her warnings about "farting his guts out" until   one Christmas morning. Before dawn, the wife went downstairs to   prepare the family feast. She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed   potatoes, gravy and, of course, a turkey. While she was taking out the   turkey's innards, a thought occurred to the wife as to how she might   solve her husband's problem. With a devilish grin on her face, she   placed the turkey guts into a bowl and quietly walked upstairs hours   before her flatulent husband would awake. While he was still soundly   asleep, she pulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her   husband's jockey shorts. She then placed all of the turkey guts into   her husband's underwear, pulled them up, replaced the covers and   tiptoed back downstairs to finish preparing the family meal. Several   hours later she heard her husband awake with his normal loud ass   trumpeting. This was soon followed by a blood curdling scream and the   sound of frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs   bathroom. The wife could not control herself and her eyes began to   tear up as she rolled on the floor laughing. After years of putting up   with him she had finally gotten even. About twenty minutes later, her   husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of   horror in his eyes. She bit her lip to keep from laughing and she   asked him what was the matter. He said, "honey, you were right - all   those years you warned me and I didn't listen to you".   "What do you mean?" asked his wife.   "Well you always told me that I would end up farting my guts out one   of these days and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God   and these two fingers, I think I got 'em all back in."

A little old lady gets onto a crowded bus and stands in front of a seated young girl. Holding her hand to her chest, she says to the girl, "If you knew what I have, you would give me your seat." The girl gets up and gives up her the seat to the old lady. It is hot. The girl then takes out a fan and starts fanning herself. The woman looks up and says, "If you knew what I have, you would give me that fan." The girl gives her the fan, too.

Fifteen minutes later the woman gets up and says to the bus driver, "Stop, I want to get off here." The bus driver tells her he has to drop her at the next corner, not in the middle of the block. With her hand across her chest, she tells the driver, "If you knew what I have, you would let me off the bus right here." The bus driver pulls over and opens the door to let her out. As she's walking out of the bus, he asks, "Madam, what is it you have?"The old woman looks at him and nonchalantly replies, "Chutzpah."

The Eighteen Bottles              I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in my cellar and was told by mywife to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, orelse.

..  I said I would and proceeded with the unpleasant task.  Iwithdrew the cork from the first bottle and poured the contents down thesink with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew thecork from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the exceptionof one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew the cork from the thirdbottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank.  I pulled thecork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the bottle down theglass, which I drank.  I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next anddrank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down the glass.  I pulled thesink out of the next glass and poured the cork down the bottle.  Then Icorked the sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour.

When I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, countedthe glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks with the other, which weretwenty-nine, and as the houses came by I counted them again, and finally Ihad all the houses in one bottle, which I drank.  I'm not under theaffluence of incohol as some thinkle peep I am.  I'm not half as thunk asyou might drink.  I fool so feelish I don't know who is me, and thedrunker I stand here, the longer I get.

A fellow decides to take off early from work and go drinking. He stays until the bar closes at 2am, at which time he is extremely drunk. When he enters his house, he doesn't want to wake anyone, so he takes off his shoes and starts tip-toeing up the stairs. Half-way up the stairs, he falls over backwards and lands flat on his rear end.

That wouldn't have been so bad, except that he had couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke, and the broken glass carved up his buttocks terribly. But, he was so drunk that he didn't know he was hurt. A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he noticed blood, so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up something terrible. Well, he repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went tobed.

The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting, and he was hunkering under the covers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom."Well, you really tied one on last night," she said. "Where'd you go?"

"I worked late," he said, "and I stopped off for a couple of beers."

"A couple of beers? That's a laugh," she replied. "You got plastered last night. Where the heck did you go?"

"What makes you so sure I got drunk last night, anyway?"

"Well," she replied, "my first big clue was when I got up this morning and found a bunch of band-aids stuck to the mirror."

The scene was Mount Olympus, where Bacchus, the Greek god of wine, had thrown a party for a pair of visiting Roman deities -- Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, and Janus, the two-faced god of doors and beginnings. Everyone overdid it, more or less. Ceres at one point was staggering and turning in circles; Janus, equally submerged, was trying to dance with her. Bacchus feared that the pair might fall over, so he went to steady them. .

1. Do not expect your doctor to share your discomfort.

Involvement with the patient's suffering might cause him to lose valuable scientific objectivity.

2. Be cheerful at all times.

Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all the gentleness and reassurance he can get.

3. Try to suffer from the disease for which you are being treated.

Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold.

4. Do not complain if the treatment fails to bring relief.

You must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight into the true nature of your illness, which transcends any mere permanent disability you may have experienced.

5. Never ask your doctor to explain what he is doing or why he is doing it.

It is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be explained in terms that you would understand.

6. Submit to novel experimental treatment readily.

Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting research paper will surely be of widespread interest.

7. Pay your medical bills promptly and willingly.

You should consider it a privilege to contribute, however modestly, to the well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.

8. Do not suffer from ailments that you cannot afford.

It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your means.

9. Never reveal any of the shortcomings that have come to light in the course of treatment by your doctor.

The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a sacred duty to protect him from exposure.

10. Never die while in your doctor's presence or under his direct care.

This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.

A lawyer died and arrived at the pearly gates. To his dismay, there were thousands of people ahead of him in line to see St. Peter. But, to his surprise, St. Peter left his desk at the gate and came down the long line to where the lawyer was standing. St. Peter greeted him warmly. Then St. Peter and one of his assistants took the lawyer by the hands and guided him up to the front of the line into a comfortable chair by his desk.

The lawyer said, "I don't mind all this attention, but what makes me so special?"St. Peter replied, "Well, I've added up all the hours for which you billed your clients, and by my calculation you must be about 193 years old!"

His friend remarked that he had gone to the same dentist a few years before. "Is that so?" the first said. "Did he do a good job?"

After a particularly poor game of golf, a popular club member skipped the clubhouse and started to go home. As he was walking to the parking lot to get his car, a policeman stopped him and asked, "Did you tee off on the sixteenth hole about twenty minutes ago?" "Yes," the golfer responded. "Did you happen to hook your ball so that it went over the trees and off the course?" "Yes, I did. How did you know?" he asked. "Well," said the policeman very seriously, "Your ball flew out onto the highway and crashed through a driver's windshield. The car went out of control, crashing into five other cars and a fire truck. The fire truck couldn't make it to the fire, and the building burned down. So, what are you going to do about it?" The golfer thought it over carefully and responded.

.. "I think I'll close my stance a little bit, tighten my grip and lower my right thumb."

A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in nine holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him. To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green. After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, "You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree." With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. The old man offered one more comment, "Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only three feet tall."

A golfer, playing a round by himself, is about to tee off, and a greasy little salesman runs up to him, and yells, "Wait! Before you tee off, I have something really amazing to show you!" The golfer, annoyed, says, "What is it?" "It's a special golf ball," says the salesman. "You can never lose it!" "Whattaya mean," scoffs the golfer, "you can never lose it? What if you hit it into the water?" "No problem," says the salesman. "It floats, and it detects where the shore is, and spins towards it." "Well, what if you hit it into the woods?" "Easy," says the salesman. "It emits a beeping sound, and you can find it with your eyes closed." "Okay," says the golfer, impressed. "But what if your round goes late and it gets dark?" "No problem, sir, this golf ball glows in the dark! I'm telling you, you can never lose this golf ball!" The golfer buys it at once. "Just one question," he says to the salesman. "Where did you get it?" "I found it."

A pastor, a doctor and an engineer were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of golfers. Engineer: What's with these guys? We must have been waiting for 15 minutes! Doctor: I don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude! Pastor: Hey, here comes the greens keeper. Let's have a word with him. [dramatic pause] Hi George. Say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they? George: Oh, yes, that's a group of blind fire fighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we always let them play for free anytime. The group was silent for a moment. Pastor: That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight. Doctor: Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them. Engineer: Why can't these guys play at night?

A blonde golfer goes into the pro shop and looks around frowning.

Finally the pro askes her what she wants. "I can't find any green golf balls," the blonde golfer complains.

The pro looks all over the shop, and through all the catalogs, and finally calls the manufacturers and determines that sure enough, there are no green golf balls.

As the blonde golfer walks out the door in disgust, the pro asks her, "Before you go, could you tell me why you want green golf balls?"

"Well obviously, because they would be so much easier to find in the sand traps!"

Two college basketball players were taking an important final exam. If they failed, they would be on academic probation and not allowed to play in the big game the following week. The exam was fill-in-the-blank.

The last question read, "Old MacDonald had a ________."Bubba was stumped. He had no idea what to answer. But he knew he needed to get this one right to be sure he passed.

Making sure the professor wasn't watching, he tapped Tiny on the shoulder. "Pssst. Tiny. What's the answer to the last question?"Tiny laughed. He looked around to make sure the professor hadn't noticed then he turned to Bubba. "Bubba, you're so stupid. Everyone knows Old MacDonald had a FARM."

"Oh yeah," said Bubba. "I remember now."He picked up his No. 2 pencil and started to write the answer in the blank. He stopped. Tapping Tiny's shoulder again, he whispered, "Tiny, how do you spell farm?"

"You are really dumb, Bubba. That's so easy. Farm is spelled E-I-E-I-O."

May I ask why you didn't give the ticket to a friend or a relative?" The man replied, "They're all at the funeral."

THE NBA PLAYER ADOPTION PROGRAM NEEDS YOU! With an NBA player's strike against the team owners looming, now is the time for us to show the world just how much we care. It's just not right. Hundreds of basketball players in our very own country are living at or just below the seven-figure salary level! Atrocious! And, as if that weren't bad enough, they will be deprived of pay for several weeks--possibly a whole year--as a result of the strike. But now you can help! For about two thousand dollars a day--that's less than the cost of a large screen projection TV--you can help a basketball player remain economically viable during his time of need. Two thousand dollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to a basketball player it could mean the difference between a vacation spent golfing in Florida or a Mediterranean cruise. For you, two thousand dollars is nothing more than three months rent or mortgage payments. But to a basketball player, two thousand dollars a day will almost replace his salary. Your commitment of two thousand dollars a day will enable a player to buy that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio. "HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING?" Each month, you will receive a complete financial report on the player you sponsor. Detailed information about his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. You'll also get information on how he plans to invest the $5 million lump sum he will receive upon retirement. Plus upon signing up for this program, you will receive a photo of the player (unsigned). Put the photo on your refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering. "HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING" Your basketball player will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need. Although the player won't know your name, he will be able to make collect calls to your home via a special operator just in case additional funds are needed for unexpected expenses. Simply fill out the form below. ___YES, I want to help! I would like to sponsor a striking NBA basketball player.

Two buddies Bob and Earl were two of the biggest baseball fans in America.

Their entire adult lives, Bob and Earl discussed baseball history in the winter, and they pored over every box score during the season. They went to 60 games a year. They even agreed that whoever died first would try to come back and tell the other if there was baseball in heaven.

One summer night, Bob passed away in his sleep after watching the Yankee victory earlier in the evening. He died happy. A few nights later, his buddy Earl awoke to the sound of Bob's voice from beyond."Bob, Is that you?" Earl asked."Of course it me," Bob replied."This is unbelievable!" Earl exclaimed. "So tell me, is there baseball in heaven?"

"Well, I have some good news and some bad news for you. Which do you want to hear first?"

"Tell me the good news first."

"Well, the good news is that yes there is baseball in heaven, Earl."

"Oh, that is wonderful! So what could possibly be the bad news?"

"You're pitching tomorrow night."

Our friends on New York Jets convinced us: "Winning's no big deal." Worried sick about Letterman botching the Academy Awards. Those big guys on other team kept trying to knock us down. Who needs all the pressure of a Super Bowl? Not us, Lonnie! What a time to notice, them cheerleader outfits is skimpy! Tired of going to Disneyland.

At the Gym For Christmas this year my wife purchased me a week of private lessons at the local health club. Though still in great shape from when I was on the varsity chess team in high school, I decided it was a good idea to go ahead and try it. I called and made reservations with someone named Tanya, who said she is a 26-year-old aerobics instructor and athletic clothing model. My wife seemed very pleased with how enthusiastic I was to get started. Day 1 They suggest I keep this "exercise diary" to chart my progress this week. Started the morning at 6:00 a.

m. Tough to get up, but worth it when I arrived at the health club and Tanya was waiting for me. She's something of a goddess, with blond hair and a dazzling white smile. She showed me the machines and took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She seemed a little alarmed that it was so high, but I think just standing next to her in that outfit of hers added about ten points. Enjoyed watching the aerobics class. Tanya was very encouraging as I did my sit ups, though my gut was already aching a little from holding it in the whole time I was talking to her. This is going to be great.

Day 2 Took a whole pot of coffee to get me out the door, but I made it. Tanya had me lie on my back and push this heavy iron bar up into the air. Then she put weights on it, for heaven's sake! Legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made it the full mile. Her smile made it all worth it. Muscles feel great Day 3 The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying the tooth brush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I am that I have developed a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was okay as long as I didn't try to steer. I parked on top of a Volkswagen. Tanya was a little impatient with me and said my screaming was bothering the other club members. The treadmill hurt my chest so I did the stair monster. Why would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by the invention of elevators? Tanya told me regular exercise would make me live longer. I can't imagine anything worse.

Day 4 Tanya was waiting for me with her vampire teeth in a full snarl. I can't help it if I was half an hour late, it took me that long just to tie my shoes. She wanted me to lift dumbbells. Not a chance, Tanya. The word "dumb" must be in there for a reason. I hid in the men's room until she sent Lars looking for me. As punishment she made me try the rowing machine. It sank. Day 5 I hate Tanya more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. If there was any part of my body not in extreme pain I would hit her with it. She thought it would be a good idea to work on my triceps. Well, I have news for you Tanya, I don't have triceps. And if you don't want dents in the floor don't hand me any barbells. I refuse to accept responsibility for the damage, you went to sadist school, you are to blame. The treadmill flung me back into a science teacher, which hurt like crazy. Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like a music teacher, or social studies? Day 6 Got Tanya's message on my answering machine, wondering where I am. I lacked the strength to use the TV remote so I watched eleven straight hours of the weather channel.

Day 7 Well, that's the week. Thank goodness that's over. Maybe next time my wife will give me something a little more fun, like free teeth drilling at the dentist's.

Top NFL Complaints After shooting the blank gun to end the half, the Dallas Cowboy players start shooting back with live ammunition. Calling "heads or tails" but never getting any. . . "head" or "tail". Players get "the wave". . . refs get "the finger". Anyone who makes a call against the Detroit Lions risks pissing off their last remaining fan. With Reggie White retired, the penalty for "Illegal use of a racial slur" is meaningless. Just when we thought it was safe to be an NFL Ref, we have to go back to frickin' CLEVELAND!

!! Thanks to instant replay, picking nose during a game is twice as risky. Everyone else gets to wear their Autumn colors, but for me it's black and white week after week after week! Don King only bribes boxing judges. Official rule books not made in Braille. I'm the one that everybody wants to kill, so where's MY helmet and pads?

Top Baseball Player Demands From Late Show with David Letterman; Friday, August 12, 1994 In case anyone has od'ed on O.

J. Simpson coverage or for those who might for some reason not know, the major league baseball player strike began today.

] No team flights on Continental Airlines. Goodbye boring baseball hats, hello festive sombreros. Make it legal to cork their pants. Baseballs with delicious chocolate centers.

Plenty of dugout Slimfast. Put an on-deck circle in Madonna's bed. More games against the Mets.

Supplemental Rules for Bowling If you holler "overs!" before the ball passes the arrows, you get to throw the ball over, unless of course, you get a strike. In which case, you can renege on the "overs". When your team is about 10 marks down in the 8th or 9th frame, you can invoke the rule "First Team Through Bowling Wins the Game", and your team still has a chance. After a member of the opposing team bowls 4 strikes in a row, he/she must bowl the next 4 frames blindfolded. If he/she continues to strike, his/her shoelaces will be tied together for 2 frames. When you leave the 10-pin and you know you can't make the spare, but another member of your team can, invoke the "Designated Bowler" rule. After you have 4 splits in one game, you may say "Kings X" and take those 4 frames over. However, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. After all, "Fair is Fair". If your ball goes in the gutter and jumps back onto the lane, knocking dow pins, by golly, you get them! That's much harder than to knock them down the conventional way. Good bowling should be recognized. A ball should be declared dead when you bowl 3 games without a strike. It shall be the owners privilege to decide on the disposition of said dead ball - Burial at Sea, Dropped from an airplane over a live volcano, or a simple burial in the city dump. For a small fee, a league officer can be bribed to deliver a short eulogy.

Snowboarding Lessons When you're 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you've reached middle age, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it." This is the voice of Satan. I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales. I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I'll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days. This is because I went snowboarding. For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough. These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool." People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together. We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill). If anybody asks if you're OK, you say, "I'm just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you're going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you're planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw. At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance. So I thought I'd take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing. In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range. Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can't stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you. Skiers hate snowboarders. It's a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc. Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd. I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope. Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who's going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete. You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.

) We learned snowboarding via a two step method: Step One: Watching Brad do something.

Step Two: Trying to do it ourselves. I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics.

I'd struggle to my feet, and I'd be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot. "Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully. Have you noticed that whatever sport you're trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if that would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "Forget my Knees! Do Something About these Gravity Chunks!" Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me. If I hadn't gotten out of there, they'd have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding. So I think, when my body heals, I'll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you'll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.

Top Ten Signs you're Not Watching a Real Baseball Team From Late Show with David Letterman; Monday, February 20, 1995 You recognize batter as the kid who sold you a hot dog a couple minutes earlier. Everytime a player slides into second, he busts his hip. They keep shouting "Do over!" When umpire yells, "Strike 3!" batter looks at him as if the dude's speaking French. Try as they might, they just can't scratch themselves like professionals. First base: Siskel. Second base: Ebert. Game stops when some lady in a house near the stadium shouts "Dinner time!" Players constantly adjusting each other's cups. You overheard the coach yelling, "Run, Forrest, run!" They play like the Mets

Murphy's Laws of Martial Arts Ten scientific principles that apply to the study of all martial arts: The wimp who made it through the eliminations on luck alone will suddenly turn into Bruce Lee when you're up against him. The referee will always be looking the other way when you score. The day you leave work early to make it to class on time, the sensei will be sick. The sensei will only use you during demonstrations for joint-locking techniques. If you have to use your training in self-defense, your attacker's father will be a lawyer. After a flawless demonstration, you will trip on your way back to your seat. After years of training without a single injury, you will pull a groin muscle the night before your black belt exam. In an otherwise vacant locker room, the only other person will have the locker right next to yours. No matter how many times you take care of it before your promotion exam, you will invariably have to go to the bathroom when it's your turn.

A young couple decided to wed. As the big day approached, they grew apprehensive. Each had a problem they had never before shared with anyone, not even each other.

The Groom-to-be, overcoming his fear, decided to ask his father for advice. "Father," he said, "I am deeply concerned about the success of my marriage."His father replied, "Don't you love this girl?"

"Oh yes, very much," he said," but you see, I have very smelly feet, and I'm afraid that my fiance will be put off by them."

"No problem," said dad, "all you have to do is wash your feet as often as possible,

and always wear socks, even to bed." Well, to him this seemed a workable solution.

The bride-to-be, overcoming her fear, decided to take her problem up with her mom." Mom," she said, "When I wake up in the morning my breath is truly awful."

"Honey," her mother consoled, "everyone has bad breath in the morning."

"No, you don't understand,

. My morning breath is so bad, I'm afraid that my fiance will not want to sleep in the same room with me."Her mother said simply, "Try this. In the morning, get straight out of bed, and head for the kitchen and make breakfast. While the family is busy eating, move on to the bathroom and brush your teeth. The key is, not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth."

"I shouldn't say good morning or anything?" the daughter asked."Not a word," her mother affirmed."Well, it's certainly worth a try," she thought.

The loving couple were finally married. Not forgetting the advice each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning silence, they managed quite well. That is, until about six months later. Shortly before dawn one morning, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of his socks had come off. Fearful of the consequences, he frantically searches the bed. This, of course, wakes his bride and without thinking, she asks, "What on earth are you doing?"

"Oh, my," he replies, "you've swallowed my sock!"

As US tourists in Israel, a man and his wife were sitting outsidea Bethlehem souvenir shop, waiting for fellow tourists.  An Arab salesman approached them carrying belts. After an impassioned sales talk yielded no results, he asked where they were from. "America," the husband replied. Looking at her dark hair and olive skin, the Arab responded. "She's not from the States." "Yes I am." said the wife. He looked at her and asked. "Is he your husband?" "Yes." she replied. Turning to the husband, he offered.

There's this old priest who got sick of all the people in his parishwho kept confessing to adultery. One Sunday, in the pulpit, he said,"If I hear one more person confess to adultery, I'll quit!" Well, everyone liked him, so they came up with a code word. Someonewho had committed adultery would say they had "fallen."This seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well, until thepriest died at a ripe old age. About a week after the new priestarrived, he visited the mayor of the town and seemed very concerned.

The priest said, "You have to do something about the sidewalks intown. When people come into the confessional, they keep talking abouthaving fallen." The mayor started to laugh, realizing that no one had told the newpriest about the code word.

Before the mayor could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger atthe mayor and said, "I don't know what you're laughing about, yourwife fell three times this week."

TO MY DEAR WIFE,

Some of the myths about marriage.

..   Husband and wife are getting all snugly in bed. Their passion is   heating up. Then the wife stops and says: "I don't feel like it, I   just want you to hold me." The husband says: "WHAT?

?" The wife   explains that he must not be in tune   with her emotional needs as a Woman. The husband realizes that nothing   is going to happen and he might as well deal with it.   So the next day the husband takes her shopping at a big dept store. He   walks around and has her try on three very expensive outfits. She   can't decide. He tells his wife to take all three of them. Then they   go over and get matching shoes worth $200 each. And then they go to   the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond ear rings. His wife   is so excited. She thinks her husband has flipped out but she does not   care. She goes for the tennis bracelet. The husband says: "But you   don't even play tennis, but OK if you like it then let's get it." The   wife is jumping up and   down so excited she cannot even believe what is going on. She says: "I   am ready to go, lets go to the cash register."   The husband says: "No - no - no, honey we're not going to buy all this   stuff." The wife's face goes blank. "No honey. I just want you to HOLD   this stuff for a while." Her face gets really mad and she is about to   explode and the Husband says: "You must not be in tune with my   financial needs as a Man!

A man met a beautiful lady and he decided he wanted to   marry her right away. She said, "But we don't know anything about each   other." He said, "That's all right, we'll learn about each other as we   go along."   So she consented, and they were married, and went on a honeymoon to a   very nice resort.   So one morning they were lying by the pool, when he got up off of his   towel, climbed up to the 10 Meter board and did a two and a half tuck   gainer, this was followed by a three rotations in jackknife position,   where he straightened out and cut the water like a knife.   After a few more demonstrations, he came back and lay down on the   towel. She said, "That was incredible!" He said, "I used to be an   Olympic diving champion. You see, I told you we'd learn more about   ourselves as we went along."   So she got up, jumped in the pool, and started doing laps. After about   thirty laps she climbed back out and lay down on her towel hardly out   of breath.   He said, "That was incredible! Were you an Olympic endurance swimmer?"   "No." she said, "I was a hooker in Venice and I worked both sides of   the canal."

A LIGHTER LOOK AT MARRIAGE    Getting married is very much like going to a continental restaurant   with friends. You order what you want, then when you see what the   other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that.   At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, "Aren't you wearing   your wedding ring on the wrong finger?" The other replied, "Yes I am,   I married the wrong man."   Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is really finished.   Marriage is an institution in which a man loses his bachelor's degree   and the woman gets her master's.   A little boy asked his father, "Daddy, how much does it cost to get   married?" And the father replied, "I don't know, son, I'm still paying   for it."   Young Son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa a man   doesn't know his wife until he marries her? Dad: That happens in most   countries, son.   Then there was a man who said, "I never knew what real happiness was   until I got married; and then it was too late.   When a newly married man looks happy, we know why. But when a ten-year   married man looks happy - we wonder why.   Married life is very frustrating. In the first year of marriage, the   man speaks and the woman listens. In the second year, the woman speaks   and the man listens. In the third year, they both speak and the   neighbors listen.   After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, "You know, I was a fool   when I married you." And the husband replied, "Yes, dear, but I was in   love and didn't notice it."   A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds: "Wife wanted". Next day he   received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing: "You can   have mine."   When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be sure of   one thing: either the car is new or the wife.   How do most men define marriage? A very expensive way to get your   laundry done free.   The most effective way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget   it once.   When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let   him keep her. - Sacha Guitry   Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in   Europe. - Jackie Mason   Marriage is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. Second   marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.

Knowing it was "now or   never", he pulls his car through three lanes of traffic, finds a   parking bay and runs into the mall. After a frantic search he finds a   toy store, goes inside and attracts the attention of a shop assistant.   When asked what he would like, he simply says "a Barbie doll".   The shop assistant looks at him in the particularly condescending   manner that only shop assistants can muster up and asks "Which Barbie   would that be, sir?" The man looks surprised so the assistant   continues "We have Barbie Goes to the Gym for $19.

95, Barbie Goes to   the Ball for $19.

"What's this, honey?" the husband asked as he entered the room. "Oh,   it's just a statue." she replied nonchalantly. "The Smiths bought one   for their bedroom. I liked the idea so much, I got one for us too." No   more was said about the "statue."   Around two in the morning, the husband got out of bed, went into the   kitchen, and returned with a sandwich and a glass of milk. "Here." he   said to the 'statue.

He died abruptly under strange circumstances and the funeral had a closed casket. After the burial, the wife went straight to the local bar and began to party as if there was no tomorrow. The gaiety of her actions were becoming extreme while her neighbors approached in a group to ask these questions: Are you not afraid? Concerned? Worried? that this man who practiced black magic and stated when he died he would dig his way up and out of the grave to come back and haunt you for the rest of your life?

AVOID SOCIAL BLUNDERS WITH THESE HELPFUL WEDDING HINTS:-  Livestock usually is a poor choice for a wedding gift.

-  Is it okay to bring a date to a wedding?     Not if you are the groom.

-  When dancing, never remove undergarments;    no matter how hot it is.

-  Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds    may get you cut.

-  A bridal veil made of window screen is not only    cost-effective, but also a proven fly deterrent.

-  For the groom, at least rent a tux.  A leisure suit    with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can    create a nice appearance.  Though uncomfortable,    say yes to socks and shoes for this special occasion.

Dear ________,

I regret to inform you that you have been eliminated from further contention as Mr. Right. As you are probably aware, the competition was exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also failed to make the final cut. I will, however, keep your name on file should an opening become available. So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition.

Check those that apply.

..

___Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it, hyphenating it, or subjecting my children to it.

___Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion.

___The fact that our dining experiences to date has left MY wallet a little lighter, and YOUR pants a little tighter!

___Your inadvertent admission that you "buy condoms by thetruckload" indicates that you may be interested in me for something otherthan my personality.

___You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.

e.

, I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself.

___Your constant emailing shows me you have TOO much time onyour hands!

___Your legs are skinnier than mine.

___You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess.

___You're too tall. I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying tokiss you.

___You have a hairy back.

___I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing.

___The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals aninherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable.

___The phrase "My Mother" has popped up far too often in conversation.

___You still live with your parents.

___Although I do enjoy the X-Files, I find your wardrobe of StarTrekuniforms a little disconcerting.

___Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker.

___Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I amseeking in a long term partner.

___Your height is out of proportion to your weight. If you should, however, happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your application.

___Somehow I doubt those condoms I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip.

___I am out of your league, set your sights lower next time.

Sincerely,

___________

When a man volunteers to do such cooking, the following chain of events is put into motion. (1) The woman goes to the store. (2) The woman fixes the salad, vegetables, and dessert. (3) The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on     a tray along with the necessary cooking utensils, and takes it     to the man, who is lounging beside the grill. (4) The man places the meat on the grill. (5) The woman goes inside to set the table and check     the vegetables. (6) The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is     burning. (7) The man takes the meat off the grill and hands it to the     woman. (8) The woman prepares the plates and brings them to the     table. (9) After eating, the woman clears the table and does the     dishes. (10) The man asks the woman how she enjoyed "her night     off." And, upon seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that     there's just no pleasing some women.

Itake my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, Iget undressed in the bathroom. I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakesup and yells at me for staying out so late!" His buddy looks at him and says, "Well, you're obviously taking thewrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my handson my wife's butt and say, 'Hey honey, wanna fool around?

' .

.and she'salways sound asleep."

As he examined the body of Mr. Schwartz, who was about to be cremated, he made an amazing discovery. Mr. Schwartz had the longest private part he had ever seen!  "I'm sorry Mr. Schwartz" said the mortician, "but I can't send youoff to be cremated with a tremendously huge private part like this.

It has to be saved for posterity."  With that, the mortician used his tools to remove the dead man'sschlong. He stuffed his prize into a briefcase and took it home.

If no one sees you eat it, it has no calories        2. If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar,                they cancel each other out.        3. When eating with someone else, calories dont count                if you both eat the same amount.        4. Foods used for medicinal purpose have no calories.                These include any chocolate used for energy,                brandy, cheesecake, and ice cream.        5. Cookie pieces contain no calories, because breakage                causes the calories to leak out.        6. If you eat food from someone else's plate, the                calories don't count.        7. Movie related snacks are much lower in calories because                they are part of the entertainment, and not ones                of personal fuel.

edu        It happens every spring: crocuses, baseball (with any luck), and the switch toDaylight Savings Time (DST).

Coming off DST is not hard.  In the Fall, we set our clocks back one hour.  Weall get an extra hour to sleep, and those who forget find themselves at church,

or the airport, or wherever an hour early.  Embarassing, but not catastrophic.

But in the Spring we set the clocks forward, and the trouble begins.  We losean hour of sleep.  Forgetful people miss Mass, planes, breakfast, and the biggame on TV.  Some are thrown into disarray for up to a full week.  Annuallosses due to DST confusion have been estimated (by me) at over a milliondollars.  I myself have missed a flight to Washington and a showing of TheSeven Samurai because of DST.

There is no need for such tragic waste.  We can -- we should and must -- urgeour lawmakers to reform Daylight Savings Time as follows:Setting clocks back is easy; setting them forward is difficult.  Therefore, letus keep the fall ritual as it is.  However, one Sunday each Spring, let us setour clocks not one hour forward, but TWENTY-THREE HOURS BACKWARD.

Think of all the advantages.  We will not lose an hour of sleep; we will gain(almost) a day of rest.  It will be Saturday all over again.  You will neveragain miss Confession, or an airplane, or the Redskins game.

Naturally, if this were the whole plan, our calendars would fall behind one dayin each year.  However, the second part of the Revised DST Plan deals withthis.  Every four years, instead of adding a day, let us SUBTRACT THREE DAYS.

Furthermore, let these be Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which according torecent polls are the least popular days.

If done in February, which seems reasonable considering what a miserable monthit is, this would have the beneficial side effect of shortening theexcruciating presidential primary season by an effective four days.

The advantages of this plan are clear.  Let us waste no time.  With a determinedeffort we can have Reformed Daylight Savings Time by Spring of next year.

One day many years ago, a fisherman's wife blessed her husband with twin sons.  They loved the children very much, but couldn't think of what to name their children.  Finally, after several days, the fisherman said, "Let's not decide on names right now.  If we wait a little while, the names will simply occur to us."After several weeks had passed, the fisherman and his wife noticed a peculiar fact.  When left alone, one of the boys would also turn towards the sea, while the other boy would face inland.  It didn't matter which way the parents positioned the children, the same child always faced the same direction.  "Let's call the boys Towards and Away," suggested the fisherman.  His wife agreed, and from that point on, the boys were simply known as TOWARDS and AWAY.

The years passed and the lads grew tall and strong.  The day came when the aging fisherman said to his sons, "Boys, it is time that learned how to make a living from the sea."  They provisioned their ship, said their goodbyes, and set sail for a three month voyage. The three months passed quickly for the fisherman's wife, yet the ship had not returned.  Another three months passed, and still no ship. Three whole years passed before the grieving woman saw a lone man walking towards her house.  She recognized him as her husband.  "My goodness!  What has happened to my darling boys?" she cried. The ragged fisherman began to tell his story:"We were just barely one whole day out to see when Towards hooked into a great fish.  Towards fought long and hard, but the fish was more than his equal.  For a whole week they wrestled upon the waves without either of them letting up. Yet eventually the great fish started to win the battle, and Towards was pulled over the side of our ship.  He was swallowed whole, and we never saw either of them again."

"Oh dear, that must have been terrible!  What a huge fish that must of been! What a horrible fish.  What a horrible fish."

"Yes, it was, but you should have seen the one that got Away.

A Guide to the Identification and Classification of North American FartsLearning- or better still, thinking up- names for fart types is atraditional early-adolescent ritual. Similarly, methods of identifyingthe source of a fart are a subject of peer-group, or tribal,

speculation, the usual rule of thumb being "Who smelled it, dealt it,"or "The smeller's the feller."Occasionally, this oral tradition has acheived the level of Xeroxpublication, but never before has a systematic analysis, along the linesof Jane's Fighting ships or A Field Guide to the Birds, been attemptedin print. Tentatively, then, we present the following.

Blind Farts:  Traditional noiseless reekers. (Expression since circa1880 - see also "SBD's").

Boomers:  Full-throated, rousing explosions; the parent orginismfrequently betrays his or her authorship with a smile of ill-conceledpride.

Carpet Creepers:  Heavier- than- air creations, these linger andpermeate the atmosphere at or near ground level; source invariablyanonymous, having left the room.

Fizzles: Efforts at first promising, but eventually unsatisfactory, atleast to the donor; often effective upon bystanders. Often the last of aseries; originator betrays disappointment.

Fudgies: See Wet Ones.

One-Cheek Sneaks: Attempted surreptitous contributions, usuallysignified BY the the artist's "tilting". Ricocheting off metal "bridgechairs" or church pews, they posses satisfactory resonance, produceblushes, giggles, glares.

Poohs:  Open-spincter donations, gusty and full-bodied, but lackingsonority; popular on buses; customarily unaknowledged.

SBD's:  (Silent But Deadly  type).  Consistant with the Law ofConservation of Energy, what SBD lacks in audible qualities iscompensated for in a semi-lethal olfactory intensity. The mechanismresponsible is usually the innocent-looking  person glancing aboutsuspiciously.

Screamers:  High-pitched, tight-spincter offerings, often of astonishingduration and tonal variations; most pleasuribly exchanged among roomatesor frat brothers, or inspired by presence of officious bureaucrat.

Sliders:  See One-Cheek Sneaks.

Squeegies: Small, immature, and moist products. Humiliating for allconcerned.

Wet Ones: (aka Brewer's Farts, Fudgies, Playing Misty). Samples areaccompnied by gutteral, rasping, or lisping sound, indicating vaporouscontent. Originator registers astonishment, dred, then departs, walkingfunny.

Whiffers: see Poohs.

My friend, Ed Peterson, over at Wellsburg, Iowa, received a checkfor $1,

000.

00  from the government for not raising hogs.  So I want togo into the "not raising hogs" business next year.  What I want to know is, in your  opinion,  what is the best  kind offarm not to  raise  hogs on and what is the best  breed of hogs not toraise?  I want to be sure that I approach  this  endeavor  in  keepingwith  all   governmental   policies.  I  would  prefer  not  to  raiserazorbacks, but if that is not a good breed not to raise, then I wouldjust as gladly not raise Yorkshires or Durocs.  As I see it, the hardest part of this  program will be in keeping anaccurate inventory of how many hogs I haven't raised.  My  friend,  Peterson,  is  very  joyful  about  the  future  of thebusiness.  He has been  raising  hogs for twenty  years or so, and thebest he ever made on them was $442.

00 in 1968, until this year when hegot your check for $1,

000.

00 for not raising hogs.  If I get $1,

000.

00 for not raising 50 hogs, will I get $2,

000.

00 fornot  raising  100 hogs?  I plan to operate on a small  scale at first,

holding  myself  down to about 4,

000 hogs not raised,  which will meanabout $80,

000.

00 the first year.  Then I can afford an airplane.  Now  another  thing.  These hogs I will not be raising  will not eat100,

000  bushels of corn.  I understand  that you also pay farmers fornot  raising  corn and  wheat.  Will I qualify  for  payments  for notraising  wheat and corn not to feed the 4,

000  hogs I am not  going toraise?  I want to get started as soon as possible as this seems to be a goodtime of the year not to raise hogs and grain.  Also, I am considering  the "not milking cows"  business, so send meany information on that too.  In view  of  these  circumstances,  you  understand  that I will  betotally  unemployed and plan to file for unemployment and food stamps.  Be assured you will have my vote in the coming election.

Patriotically yours,

A young peasant girl of fourteen went to work in a broom factory.  After 2 months she gave the boss a two-week notice. The boss was quite unhappy to let her go since she was hard working, knew her tasks etc.  He called her into his office, "But why?" he asked."Nothin, I just wanna quit that's all,"  she said sullenly."Look, I'll give you a raise."

"No," she said"You can't just quit like that. There must be a reason. Tell me."

"Okay if you must know.

.." said the girl, and she took off herunderwear and pointed to her pubic hair, "Look I haven't had this before, it's the broom's bristles, I tell you.

Changing of the English LanguageHaving chosen English as the preferred language in the EEC, the EuropeanParliament has commissioned a feasibility study in ways of improvingefficiency in communications between Government departments.

European officials have often pointed out that English spelling isunnecessarily difficult - for example, cough, plough, rough, through andthorough. What is clearly needed is a phased programme of changes toiron out these anomalies. The programme would, of course, beadministered by a committee staff at top level by participating nations.

In the first year, for example, the committee would suggest using 's'instead of the soft 'c'. Sertainly, sivil servants in all sities wouldresieve this news with joy. Then the hard 'c' could be replaced by 'k'sinse both letters are pronounsed alike. Not only would this klear upkonfusion in the minds of klerikal workers, but typewriters kould bemade with one less letter.

There would be growing enthusiasm when in the sekond year, it kould beannounsed that the troublesome 'ph' would henseforth be written 'f'.

This would make words like 'fotograf' twenty per sent shorter in print.

In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expektedto reash the stage where more komplikated shanges are possible.

Governments would enkourage the removal of double letters which havealways been a deterent to akurate speling.

We would al agre that the horible mes of silent 'e's in the languag isdisgrasful. Therefor we kould drop thes and kontinu to read and writ asthough nothing had hapend. By this tim it would be four years sins theskem began and peopl would be reseptive to steps sutsh as replasing 'th'by 'z'. Perhaps zen ze funktion of 'w' kould be taken on by 'v', vitshis, after al, half a 'w'. Shortly after zis, ze unesesary 'o kould bedropd from words kontaining 'ou'.

Bloke is drinking at a pub and after a few rounds goes to leave, explaining to the barman he has to go home to do a shit. "Don't be stupid," says the barman, "We've got a perfectly good toilet here!" "Yes," explains the drinker, "but I take salts."

"So what?

?

!

! That doesn't matter - you can still use the toilet here!"The drinker reluctantly agrees and heads for the toilet. After a few moments there is loud banging and the bloke emerges, followed by a foul smell. The barman races into the toilet where he sees crap all over the ceiling and walls. He races back into the bar. "What the hell went on in there?

!" he demands."I told you," explained the drinker."No, you said that you take salts!" yelled the barman."That's right," the drinker shrugs, "somersaults."

Pillsbury Dough Boy wanted for attempted murderA lady named Linda went to Arkansas last week to visit her in-laws,

and while there, went to a store.  She parked next to a car with a womansitting in it, her eyes closed and hands behind her head, apparentlysleeping.  When Linda came out a while later, she again saw the woman,

her hands still behind her head but with her eyes open.

The woman looked very strange, so Linda tapped on the window and said,"Are you okay?"  The woman answered, "I've been shot in the head, and Iam holding my brains in."Linda didn't know what to do, so she ran into the store, where storeworkers called the paramedics.  They had to break into the car becausethe door was locked.  When they got in, they found that the woman hadbread dough on the back of her head and in her hands.

A Pillsbury biscuit cannister had exploded, apparently from the heatin the car, making a loud explosion like that of a gunshot, and hit herin the head. When she reached back to find what it was, she felt thedough and thought it was her brains.  She passed out from fright atfirst, then attempted to hold her brains in.

Preparation for ParenthoodPreparation for parenthood is not just a matter of reading books anddecorating the nursery. Here are 12 simple tests for expectant parentsto take to prepare themselves for the real-life experience of being amother or father.

1. Women: to prepare for maternity, put on a dressing gown and stick abeanbag down the front. Leave it there for 9 months. After 9 months,

take out 10% of the beans.   Men: to prepare for paternity, go the local drug store, tip thecontents of your wallet on the counter, and tell the pharmacist tohelp himself. Then go to the supermarket. Arrange to have your salarypaid directly to their head office. Go home. Pick up the paper andread it for the last time.

2. Before you finally go ahead and have children, find a couple whoare already parents and berate them about their methods ofdiscipline, lack of patience, appallingly low tolerance levels, andhow they have allowed their children to run riot. Suggest ways inwhich they might improve their child's sleeping habits, toilettraining, table manners and overall behavior. Enjoy it - it'll be thelast time in your life that you will have all of the answers.

3. To discover how the nights feel, walk around, the living room from5pm to 10pm carrying a wet bag weighing approximately 8-12 lbs. at10pm put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight, and go to sleep.

Get up at 12 and walk around the living room again, with the bag,

until 1am. Put the alarm on for 3am. As you can't get back to sleep,

get up at 2am and make a drink. Go to bed at 2:45 am. Get up again at3am when the alarm goes off. Sing songs in the dark until 4am. Put thealarm on for 5am. Get up. Make breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years.

Look cheerful.

4. Can you stand the mess children make? To find out, smear peanutbutter onto the sofa and jam onto the curtains. Hide a fish fingerbehind the stereo and leave it there all summer. Stick your fingers inthe flowerbeds then rub them on the clean walls. Cover the stains withcrayons. How does that look?

5. Dressing small children is not as easy as it seems: first buy anoctopus and a string bag. Attempt to put the octopus into the stringbag so that none of the arms hang out. Time allowed for this - allmorning.

6. Take an egg carton. Using a pair of scissors and a can of paint,

turn it into an alligator. Now take a toilet tube. Using only scotchtape and a piece of foil, turn it into a Christmas tree. Last, take amilk container, a ping pong ball, and an empty packet of Coco Puffsand make an exact replica of the Eiffel Tower. Congratulations, youhave just qualified for a place on the playgroup committee.

7. Forget the Miata and buy a Mini Van. And don't think you can leaveit out in the driveway spotless and shining. Family cars don't looklike that. Buy a chocolate ice cream bar and put it in the glovecompartment.  Leave it there.  Get a quarter. Stick it in the cassetteplayer. Take a family-size packet of chocolate cookies. Mash them downthe back seats.  Run a garden rake along both sides of the car.

There!

, Perfect!

8. Get ready to go out. Wait outside the toilet for half an hour. Goout the front door. Come in again. Go out. Come back in. Go out again.

Walk down the front path. Walk back up it. Walk down it again. Walkvery slowly down the road for 5 minutes. Stop to inspect minutelyevery cigarette butt, piece of used chewing gum, dirty tissue and deadinsect along the way. Retrace your steps. Scream that you've had asmuch as you can stand, until the neighbors come out and stare at you.

Give up and go back in the house. You are now just about ready to trytaking a small child for a walk.

9. Always repeat everything you say at least five times.

10. Go to your local supermarket. Take with you the nearest thing youcan find to a pre-school child - a fully grown goat is excellent. Ifyou intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat. Buyyour week's groceries without letting the goats out of your sight. Payfor everything the goats eat or destroy. Until you can easilyaccomplish this do not even contemplate having children.

11. Hollow out a melon. Make a small hole in the side. Suspend it fromthe ceiling and swing it from side to side. Now get a bowl of soggyFroot Loops and attempt to spoon it into the swaying melon bypretending to be an airplane. Continue until half of the Froot Loopsare gone. Tip the rest into your lap, making sure that a lot of itfalls on the floor. You are now ready to feed a 12-month old baby.

12. Learn the names of every character from Barney and Friends, SesameStreet and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. When you find yourselfsinging "I love you, you love me" at work, now!

, you finally qualifyas a parent.

Politically Correct                                 Little Red Riding HoodThere once was a young person named Little Red Riding Hood who livedon the edge of a large forest full of endangered owls and rare plants thatwould probably provide a cure for cancer if only someone took the time tostudy them.

Red Riding Hood lived with a nurture giver whom she sometimes referred toas "mother", although she didn't mean to imply by this term that she would havethought less of the person if a close biological link did not in fact exist.

Nor did she intend to denigrate the equal value of nontraditional households,

although she was sorry if this was the impression conveyed.

One day her mother asked her to take a basket of organically grown fruit andmineral water to her grandmother's house."But mother, won't this be stealing work from the unionized people whohave struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages betweenvarious people in the woods?"Red Riding Hood's mother assured her that she had called the union bossand gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form."But mother, aren't you oppressing me by ordering me to do this?"Red Riding Hood's mother pointed out that it was impossible for womynto oppress each other, since all womyn were equally oppressed until allwomyn were free."But mother, then shouldn't you have my brother carry the basket, sincehe's an oppressor, and should learn what it's like to be oppressed?"And Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her brother was attendinga special rally for animal rights, and besides, this wasn't stereotypicalwomyn's work, but an empowering deed that would help engender afeeling of community."But won't I be oppressing Grandma, by implying that she's sick andhence unable to independently further her own selfhood?"But Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her grandmother wasn'tactually sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way,

although that was not to imply that any of these conditions wereinferior to what some people called "health".

Thus Red Riding Hood felt that she could get behind the idea of deliveringthe basket to her grandmother, and so she set off.

Many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerousplace, but Red Riding Hood knew that this was an irrational fear based oncultural paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regardedthe natural world as an exploitable resource, and hence believed thatnatural predators were in fact intolerable competitors.

Other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants, butRed Riding Hood felt that in a truly classless society all marginalized peopleswould be able to "come out" of the woods and be accepted as validlifestyle role models.

On her way to Grandma's house, Red Riding Hood passed a woodchopper, andwandered off the path, in order to examine some flowers.

She was startled to find herself standing before a Wolf, who asked her whatwas in her basket.

Red Riding Hood's teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers,

but she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality, andchose to dialogue with the Wolf.

She replied, "I am taking my Grandmother some healthful snacks in a gestureof solidarity."The Wolf said, "You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl to walkthrough these woods alone."Red Riding Hood said, "I find your sexist remark offensive in the extreme, butI will ignore it because of your traditional status as an outcast from society,

the stress of which has caused you to develop an alternative and yet entirelyvalid worldview.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I would prefer to be on my way."Red Riding Hood returned to the main path, and proceeded towards herGrandmother's house.

But because his status outside society had freed him from slavish adherence tolinear, Western-style thought, the Wolf knew of a quicker route to Grandma'shouse. He burst into the house and ate Grandma, a course of action affirmative ofhis nature as a predator.

Then, unhampered by rigid, traditionalist gender role notions, he put onGrandma's nightclothes, crawled under the bedclothes, and awaited developments.

Red Riding Hood entered the cottage and said,"Grandma, I have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you in yourrole of wise and nurturing matriarch."The Wolf said softly "Come closer, child, so that I might see you."Red Riding Hood said, "Goddess!  Grandma, what big eyes you have!"

"You forget that I am optically challenged."

"And Grandma, what an enormous, what a fine nose you have."

"Naturally, I could have had it fixed to help my acting career, but I didn'tgive in to such societal pressures, my child."

"And Grandma, what very big, sharp teeth you have!"The Wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs, and, in a reactionappropriate for his accustomed milieu, he leaped out of bed, grabbedLittle Red Riding Hood, and opened his jaws so wide that she could seeher poor Grandmother cowering in his belly."Aren't you forgetting something?" Red Riding Hood bravely shouted.  "Youmust request my permission before proceeding to a new level of intimacy!"The Wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his grasp on her.

At the same time, the woodchopper burst into the cottage, brandishing an ax."Hands off!" cried the woodchopper."And what do you think you're doing?" cried Little Red Riding Hood.  "If I letyou help me now, I would be expressing a lack of confidence in my own abilities,

which would lead to poor self esteem and lower achievement scores on collegeentrance exams."

"Last chance, sister!  Get your hands off that endangered species!  Thisis an FBI sting!" screamed the woodchopper, and when Little Red RidingHood nonetheless made a sudden motion, he sliced off her head."Thank goodness you got here in time," said the Wolf.  "The brat and hergrandmother lured me in here.  I thought I was a goner."

"No, I think I'm the real victim, here," said the woodchopper.  "I've beendealing with my anger ever since I saw her picking those protected flowersearlier.  And now I'm going to have such a trauma.  Do you have any aspirin?"

"Sure," said the Wolf."Thanks."

"I feel your pain," said the Wolf, and he patted the woodchopper on hisfirm, well padded back, gave a little belch, and said "Do you have any Maalox?"                                   Thomas E. Maloney

-  when you don't use turn signals because everybody knows where you're going.

-  if you're born on June 13 and your family receives gifts from the local   merchants because you're the first baby of the year.

-  if you speak to each dog you pass, by name .

..

.. and he wags his tail   at you-  if you dial the wrong number, and talk for 15 minutes anyway.

-  when the biggest business in town sells farm machinery.

-  if you write a check on the wrong bank and it covers you anyway.

-  if you missed church on Sunday and the preacher sends you a get-well card!

A widow was feeling rather lonely and decided that the best thing forher would be to have a companion. So, off she went to the pet shop.

She wasn't sure just what kind of pet she'd like, so she figured she'djust walk around until she found just the 'right one.

' She went pastthe adorable little puppies, past the playful kittens, past thepreening birds, past the sleeping hamsters, past the whirling gerbils,

and past the colorful fish.

Nothing really appealed to her and seemed to be just what she waslooking for. She decided to go around the store again.

On the way over to the puppies, she walked by a barrel. At the bottomof the barrel was a rather nasty looking toad. When she looked in, heWINKED at her! Our poor widow just shook herself! She couldn'tbelieve it. She rather quickly went back to the other pets ondisplay.

Once again, she checked out those sweet little puppies, the darlingkittens, the fluttering birds, the fuzzy hamsters, the sleek gerbils,

and the darting fish. Nothing really, really did it for her. She wasstarting to get discouraged. So, she figured one last time around,

just in case she missed something.

Going by the barrel again, she took another peek. There was thatnasty toad, and this time, he puckered up & threw her a kiss!

!This was almost too much for the poor widow and she just aboutran over to the other pets.

She tried hard to find just the right one to take home with her, butnot one of those cute puppies or silky kittens or chirping birds orgolden hamsters or skinny gerbils or fancy fish seemed right for her.

Totally discouraged by now, the widow decide to go home.

On the way out of the shop, she had to walk past the barrel again. Asshe furtively peeked in, the toad just gave her the most beseechinglook, and he had a little tear on the corner of his eye. He evensniffed a bit. This was too much for our widow, she started headingfor the exit in a hurry.

All of a sudden it struck her that this poor toad was probably just aslonely as she was. Not only that, but he was so ugly that no onewould probably buy him, especially not with all the other nice petsavailable.

So up to the counter she marched, told the salesperson she'd take thetoad, but requested that he be put in a sturdy box. When she got toher car, she placed the box on the seat next to her and proceeded todrive home.

As she was driving along, she heard some scratching coming from thebox. She tried to ignore it for a bit, but then thought that the toadmight need some air, so she opened the box a bit. (What could ithurt?

)She would glance over at the toad from time to time, and he keptwinking at her and throwing her kisses. She finally thought,"oh heck, what could it hurt?" and she leaned over and KISSED him!

And POOF! He turned into a HANDSOME PRINCE!

!!

And do you know what our poor widow turned into?

The first motel she came to!

The Speed of Time by Age 0-9  Extremely slow. Even a trip to the store with Mom seems like going      to Albania - by covered wagon. Most common phrase: "Is it      Christmas yet?"10-19 Still slow. Scientific evidence seems to show that school clocks      actually move backwards just before the bell rings.

20-29 Alternately fast and slow. Weekends seem shorter and shorter, yet      paychecks seem further and further apart.

30-39 Time achieves warp speed, except when put on hold on the telephone      and forced to endure anything longer than 5 seconds of Muzak. Most      common phrase: "Is it Christmas already?"40-49 Still fast. Seems like just yesterday when Jerry Brown said he      might run for President. Wait a minute! It WAS yesterday when he      said that. Also, Dick Clark still looks the same. Could time be      slowing down?

60-69 Hey! What happened to 50-59?

70 +  Unbelievably fast. Wars used to last years. Now it seems like      they're over in a couple weeks.

I can't believe that. I've never had any trouble with my chickens.

I'll give you 100 more."Another two weeks went by, and the neighbor stops in again. The newfarmer says, "You're not going to believe this, but the second 100chickens died too." Astounded, the neighbor asked, "what went wrong?

What did you do to them?"Well, says the new farmer, "I'm not sure whether I'm planting them toodeep or not far apart enough."

Two So-Cal guys were picked up by the cops for smoking dope and appeared in court before the judge. The judge said, "You seem like nice young men, and I'd like to give you a second chance rather than jail time. I want you togo out this weekend and try to show others the evils of drug use and get them to give up drugs forever. I'll see you back in court Monday.

Monday, the two guys were in court, and the judge said to the first one, "How did you do over the weekend?"

"Well, your honor, I persuaded 17 people to give up drugs forever." "17 people? That's wonderful. What did you tell them?"

"I used a diagram, your honor. I drew two circles like this:                       _                    /   \                   |     |        O                     \ _ /and told them this (the big circle) is your brain before drugs and this (small circle) is your brain after drugs."

"That's admirable," said the judge. "And you, how did you do?" (to the 2nd boy)"Well, your honor, I persuaded 156 people to give up drugs forever." "156 people! That's amazing! How did you manage to do that!" "Well, I used the same two circles.  I pointed to thesmall circle and told them, "this is your asshole before prison.

There was an airplane full of a shipment of Pepsi flying over Africa.   It suddenly had a malfunction and went down. A few weeks later,   PepsiCo sent a rescue plane out to look for the lost plane. They found the   wreckage but were unable to locate the crew. They searched the area   and found a tribe of cannibals. They walked up to the Chief of the tribe   and asked him if he knew anything about the crash. The Chief says,   "Yeah". When asked where the crew was the Chief replied, "We ate the   crew and drank the Pepsi." The Rescue crew was shocked. One man asked,   "Did you eat their legs?" The chief replied, "We ate their legs and we   drank the Pepsi." Another rescuer asked, "Did you eat their arms?" The   Chief said, "We ate their arms, and we drank the Pepsi". After looking   totally perplexed for a minute a third added, "Did you.

John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform,   and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central   Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he   didn't, the girl with the rose.   His interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida   library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not   with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin.   The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind.   In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name,   Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She now   lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and   inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for   service in World War II. During the next year and one month the two   grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on   a fertile heart. A romance was budding. Blanchard requested a   photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it   wouldn't matter what she looked like. When the day finally came for   him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting - 7:00 PM at   the Grand Central Station in New York. "You'll recognize   me," she wrote, "by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel."   So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he   loved, but whose face he'd never seen.   I'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened:   A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her   blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as   flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale   green suit she was like springtime come alive. I started toward her,   entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose.   As I moved, a small, provocative smile curved her lips. "Going my way,   sailor?" she murmured. Almost uncontrollably I made one step closer to   her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell.   She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past   40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump,   her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the   green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as   though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and   yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly   companioned me and upheld my own. And there she stood. Her pale, plump face was   gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I   did not hesitate.   My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that   was to identify me to her. This would not be love, but it would be   something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a   friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful.   I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman,   even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my   disappointment.   "I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so   glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?"   The woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. "I don't know what   this is about, son," she answered, "but the young lady in the green   suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she   said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you   that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She   said it was some kind of test!"   It's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom.   The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the   unattractive.   "Tell me whom you love," Houssaye wrote, "And I will tell you who you   are."

The FishermanOne day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.

About that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family."You aren't going to catch many fish that way," said the businessman to the fisherman, "you should be working rather than lying on the beach!"The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, "And what will my reward be?"

"Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!" was the businessman's answer."And then what will my reward be?" asked the fisherman, still smiling.

The businessman replied, "You will make money and you'll be able to buy a boat, which will thenresult in larger catches of fish!"

"And then what will my reward be?" asked the fisherman again.

The businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman's questions. "You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!" he said."And then what will my reward be?" repeated the fisherman.

The businessman was getting angry. "Don't you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!"Once again the fisherman asked, "And then what will my reward be?"The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, "Don't you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won't have a care in the world!"The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, "And what do you think I'm doing right now?"

A merchant captain and several of his officers were returning to the   ship after a big night   ashore. As they climbed the gangway the captain threw up all over   himself. Pointing to an   apprentice seaman above him he shouted, "Give that man five days in   the brig for vomiting   on me!"

"And what happened to your hand?"   "We attacked a man-o'-war," says the Captain, "and one of the   attackees chopped it off   with a saber."   "Awful," says the sailor. "And how did you lose your eye?"   "Seagull droppings," says the Captain.   "Amazing," says the sailor. "I didn't know seagull droppings could put   your eye out."   "Can't," says the Captain.

There was this fisherman that always had a good day fishing.   His friend, the game warden, couldn't figure out how he did   it, so one day the game warden decided to go fishing with   his friend. The fisherman took his friend the warden out   to his favorite spot. Once there, the fisherman took a   stick of dynamite out of his backpack, lit it, and threw   it into the water. The dynamite exploded and a dozen fish   floated to the top. The game warden said, "That's illegal,   you can't do that."The fisherman goes, "Really?" He then   lights another stick of dynamite and throws it into the water.   The dynamite exploded, and a dozen more fish floated to the   top. The game warden said, "Stop that now, and take this   boat back to shore.

..

I'm going to have to give you a citation   and confiscate all your gear." The fisherman said,"Oh, really?"   He then lights another stick of dynamite, throws it into   the game warden's lap, and said "You gonna sit there and   keep flapping your trap, or are you gonna fish?"

Eugene d'Albert (noted German composer) was married six   times. At an evening reception which he attended with his fifth wife   shortly after their wedding, he presented the lady to a friend who   said politely, "Congratulations, Herr d'Albert; you have rarely   introduced me to so charming a wife."   During a visit to America, Winston Churchill was invited to a buffet   luncheon at which cold fried chicken was served. Returning for a   second helping, he asked politely, "May I have some breast?"   "Mr. Churchill," replied the hostess, "in this country we ask for   white meat or dark meat." Churchill apologized profusely.   The following morning, the lady received a magnificent orchid from her   guest of honor. The accompanying card read: "I would be most obliged   if you would pin this on your white meat."   Sentenced to two years hard labor (for Sodomy), Oscar Wilde stood   handcuffed in driving rain waiting for transport to prison.

The local bar was so sure that its bartender was the   strongest man around that they offered a standing $1,

) but nobody could do it.   One day this scrawny little man came in, wearing thick glasses and a   polyester suit, and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, "I'd like to try   the bet." After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK,   grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled   remains of the rind to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned   to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six   drops fell into the glass.   As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1,

000.

00, and asked the   little man, "what do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a   weightlifter, or what?" The man replied, "I work for the IRS."

A man, called to testify at the IRS, asked his accountant   for advice on what to wear. "Wear your shabbiest clothing. Let him   think you are a pauper." Then he asked his lawyer the same question,   but got the opposite advice. "Do not let them intimidate you. Wear   your most elegant suit and tie." Confused, the man went to his rabbi,   told him of the conflicting advice, and requested some resolution of   the dilemma. "Let me tell you a story," replied the rabbi. "A woman,   about to be married, asked her mother what to wear on her wedding   night. 'Wear a heavy, long, flannel nightgown that goes right up to   your neck.

' But when she asked her best friend, she got conflicting   advice. 'Wear your most sexy negligee, with a V-neck right down to   your navel. The man protested: "What does all this have to do with my   problem with the IRS?" "No matter what you wear, you are going to get   screwed."

A little old lady goes into the Chase Manhattan Bank, and   says she wants to open a savings account. The accounts person asks her   how much she would like to deposit to open the account and the little   old lady says, "Three million dollars." The accounts person is   startled, and says, "In what form?" and the little old lady says,   "Cash. I've got it here in this bag.

.." and the accounts person looks   and, sure enough, the lady has a big grocery bag just chock full of   green stuff with big denominations. This is a highly unusual event,   and the accounts person excuses herself to get the president of the   bank to handle this one. He arrives, and escorts the little old lady   to his office to handle it personally. Once in his office, he asks the   little old lady where she got so much money. She says, "Gambling."   "Gambling?", he says. "What sort of gambling?" "Oh, I make bets with   people on all sorts of things, and I usually win. For example, I've   got $100,

000 right here that says that by noon tomorrow your balls   will be square, and I'll even give you 4:1 odds. You got $25,

000 you'd   be willing to wager on that?" The bank president is shocked at this   sort of thing coming from a sweet little old lady, but he didn't get   to be the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank without knowing   something about money. "I suppose I could come up with enough to cover   that sort of wager, but I wouldn't feel right taking it from   you.

..

there's no way you can win a bet like that!" The little old lady   just shook the bag, and said, "I know what I'm doing.

..

and I can   afford to lose, though I'm not going to. Is it a bet?" "Ok, have it   your way", said the president, and they shook hands on it. "See you at   11:55 tomorrow morning", said the little old lady, and with that she   left. Next morning at 11:55 the little old lady arrives with a younger   man in a three-piece suit, and is escorted to the bank president's   office. The president is a nervous wreck, though a happy one. He'd   gotten almost no sleep the night before, waking every few minutes to   feel his balls to check for impending squareness, but nothing happened   all night. He had checked hundreds of times that morning, but still   nothing; perfectly normal. When the little old lady arrived he started   to relax, knowing he had won. "Come in, please have a seat! Who might   this gentleman be?" said the president. "He's my lawyer. For a bet of   this size I want to have a witness. Any objections?" "No, perfectly   understandable", said the president. "Well, it's now noon, and I'm   still unchanged, so I guess I win!" he said happily. "Not so fast!"   said the little old lady. "For a hundred grand I want to verify things   personally! Please drop your pants." The bank president is a bit   flustered, but agrees that in her position he'd want proof as well, so   he drops his pants. The little old lady goes over to him and reaches   out to feel the organs in question. "Ok, you win, here's your   $100,

000," says the little old lady, handing over a bag of bills. As   she does so, her lawyer starts banging his head against the wall and   moaning. "What's wrong with him?" asks the bank president. "Oh, he's   just upset. Poor loser if you ask me. You see, I had a bet for   $1,

000,

000 with him that I would have the President of the Chase   Manhattan Bank by the balls by noon today."

Juan comes up to the Mexican border on his bicycle. He's   got two large bags over his shoulders. The guard stops him and says,   "What's in the bags?"   "Sand," answered Juan.   The guard says, "We'll just see about that get off the bike."   The guard takes the bags and rips them apart; he empties them out and   finds nothing in them but sand. He detains Juan overnight and has the   sand analyzed, only to discover that there is nothing but pure sand in   the bags.   The guard releases Juan, puts the sand into new bags, hefts them onto   the man's shoulders, and lets him cross the border.   A week later, the same thing happens. The guard asks, "What have you   got?"   "Sand," says Juan.   The guard does his thorough examination and discovers that the bags   contain nothing but sand. He gives the sand back to Juan, and Juan   crosses the border on his bicycle.   This sequence of events if repeated every day for three years.   Finally, Juan doesn't show up one day and the guard meets him in a   Cantina in Mexico.   "Hey, Buddy," says the guard, "I know you are smuggling something.   It's driving me crazy.

You have to read the whole thing:   The following is from a 1950's Home Economics textbook intended for   the High School girls, teaching how to prepare for married life.   1. Have dinner ready: Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a   delicious meal - on time. This is a way of letting him know that you   have been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs. Most   men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a good meal   are part of the warm welcome needed.   2. Prepare yourself: Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed   when he arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and   be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be   a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring day may need a   lift.   3. Clear away the clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of   the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up school books,   toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband   will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give   you a lift too.   4. Prepare the children: Take a few minutes to wash the children's   hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if necessary,   change their clothes. They are little treasures and he would like to   see them playing the part.   5. Minimize the noise: At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise   of washer, dryer, dishwasher, or vacuum. Try to encourage the children   to be quiet. Be happy to see him. Greet him with a warm smile and be   glad to see him.   6. Some DON'TS: Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't   complain if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared with   what he might have gone through that day.   7. Make him comfortable: Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or   suggest he lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready   for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in   a low, soft, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax and   unwind.   8. Listen to him: You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the   moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first.   9. Make the evening his: Never complain if he does not take you out to   dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to understand   his world of strain and pressure and his need to be home and relax.   10. The Goal: Try to make your home a place of peace and order where   your husband can relax.   *********************************************************   Now the updated version for the '90s woman.   1. Have dinner ready: Make reservations ahead of time. If your day   becomes too hectic just leave him a voice mail message regarding where   you'd like to eat and at what time. This lets him know that your day   has been crappy and gives him an opportunity to change your mood.   2. Prepare yourself: A quick stop at the "LANCOME" counter on your way   home will do wonders for your outlook and will keep you from becoming   irritated every time he belches at the table. (Don't forget to use his   credit card!

)   3. Clear away the clutter: Call the housekeeper and let her know   you'll need her for an extra day this week. Tell her that any   miscellaneous items left on the floor by the children can be placed in   the Goodwill box in the garage.   4. Prepare the children: Drop them off at grandma's!   5. Minimize the noise: When he arrives at home remind him that the   washer and garbage disposal are still not working properly and the   noise is driving you crazy (but do this in a nice way and greet him   with a warm smile.

..

this way he might fix it faster).   6. Some DON'TS: Don't greet him with problems and complaints. Let him   speak first, and then your complaints will get more attention and   remain fresh in his mind throughout dinner. Don't complain if he's   late for dinner. Simply remind him that the last one home does the   cooking and the cleanup.   7. Make him comfortable: Remind him where he can find a warm fuzzy   blanket if he's cold. This will show you really care.   8. Listen to him: But don't ever let him get the last word.   9. Make the evening his: a chance to get the washer and garbage   disposal fixed.   10. The Goal: To try to keep things amicable without reminding him   that you make more money than he does.

A man is waiting for his wife to give birth. The doctor   comes in and informs the dad that his son was born without torso, arms   or legs. The son is just a head! But the dad loves his son and raises   him as well as he can, with love and compassion.   After 21 years, the son is old enough for his first drink. Dad takes   him to the bar and tearfully tells the son he is proud of him. Dad   orders up the biggest, strongest drink for his boy. With all the bar   patrons looking on curiously and the bartender shaking his head in   disbelief, the boy takes his first sip of alcohol. Swoooop! A torso   pops out! The bar is dead silent; then bursts into a whoop of joy. The   father, shocked, begs his son to drink again.   The patrons chant "take another drink!" The bartender still shakes his   head in dismay. Swoooop! Two arms pops out. The bar goes wild. The   father, crying and wailing, begs his son to drink again. The patrons   chant "take another drink!" The bartender ignores the whole affair.   By now the boy is getting tipsy, and with his new hands he reaches   down, grabs his drink and guzzles the last of it. Swoooop! Two legs   pop out. The bar is in chaos. The father thanks God. The boy stands up   on his new legs and stumbles to the left.

The bartender cleans   his glasses and whistles an old Irish tune. The father looks at the   bartender in disbelief and asks, "How can you be so cold and callous?"   The bartender says, "That boy should have quit while he was a head."

The Letter D Pulls Out   LETTER D PULLS SPONSORSHIP FROM SESAME STREET   Noted Consonant Alienated By Controversial New Gay Muppet   NEW YORK--A spokesperson for the letter D announced Monday that the   consonant is withdrawing sponsorship from Sesame Street following a   Children's Television Workshop announcement that a homosexual muppet   will soon join the show's cast.   "The letter D is proud to have brought you many wonderful Sesame   Street episodes throughout the program's 28-year history," said   Patricia Willis, public-relations director for D. "But the letter D   does not condone the sort of morally questionable lifestyles that   Sesame Street is advocating with the introduction of this new   character. It can no longer in good conscience associate itself with   the show." Willis said D's withdrawal is effective immediately, and   applies to both capital and lower-case versions of the letter.   The gay muppet, "Bruce," will be introduced on Sesame Street Dec. 23,   CTW director Leslie Charren said. Thus far, no other sponsors have   pulled out, though the number seven has requested an advance tape of   the episode before it makes a decision.   Many public-television insiders believe D's withdrawal was motivated   by a desire not to alienate religious conservatives, a section of the   population that employs the letter frequently.   "D is for, among other things, demagoguery, dogma and doctrine, words   crucial to right-wing groups like the Christian Coalition," said Yale   University political-science professor J. Wright Franklin. "It is   likely that D felt it could ill afford to offend such a large segment   of its users."   While a long-term replacement for D has not yet been secured by Sesame   Street, the number three will temporarily fill in for it in a number   of the show's animated shorts. Other pieces will simply skip from C to   E, with vocalists stretching out C into two syllables to match the   rhythm of the alphabet song.   Sesame Street is stung by the sudden departure of its longtime   supporter. Speaking to reporters, cast member Cookie Monster said: "Me   disappointed letter D choose to end relationship with Sesame Street   due to pressure from extremely vocal minority. We accused of endorsing   deviant lifestyle. Me say homosexuality natural, not immoral.   Diversity and enrichment. That's good enough for me." ----------------   Q: How do you find Ronald McDonald on a nude beach?   A: It's easy, he's the one with the sesame seed buns!

A pheasant was standing in a field chatting to a bull. "I   would love to be able to get to the top of yonder tree", sighed the   pheasant, "but I haven"t got the energy".   Well, why don"t you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.   "They"re packed with nutrients".   The pheasant pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave   him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. The next   day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch and so   on. Finally, after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the   top of the tree, whereupon he was spotted by a farmer who dashed into   the farmhouse, emerged with a shotgun, and shot the pheasant right out   of the tree.   Moral of the Story:   Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won"t keep you there.

One day the different parts of the body were having anargument to see which should be in charge.

The brain said "I do all the thinking so I'm the mostimportant and I should be in charge."The eyes said "I see everything and let the rest of youknow where we are, so I'm the most important and Ishould be in charge."The hands said "Without me we wouldn't be able to pickanything up or move anything. So I'm the most importantand I should be in charge."The stomach said "I turn the food we eat into energy forthe rest of you. Without me, we'd starve. So I'm the mostimportant and I should be in charge."The legs said "Without me we wouldn't be able to moveanywhere. So I'm the most important and I should be incharge."Then the rectum said "I think I should be in charge."All the rest of the parts said "YOU?

!? You don't doanything!  You're not important! You can't be in charge."So the rectum closed up.  After a few days, the legs were allwobbly, the stomach was all queasy, the hands were all shaky,

the eyes were all watery, and the brain was all cloudy.

They all agreed that they couldn't take any more of this andagreed to put the rectum in charge.

Dec. 8   5:00 p.

m. - It's starting to snow, the first of     the season, and the wife and I took our buttered rum and sat     by the window watching the soft flakes drift down, clinging     to the trees and covering the ground. It was so beautiful. Dec. 9 - We awoke to a big beautiful blanket of crystal     white snow covering the landscape. What a fantastic sight.     Every tree and shrub covered with a beautiful white mantel.     I shoveled snow for the first time in years, and I loved it.     I did both our driveway and our sidewalks. Later the     snowplow came along and covered up our driveway with     compacted snow from the street. He smiled and I waved back.     I shoveled it again. Dec. 12 - The sun has melted most of our lovely snow. Oh     well, I'm sure we'll get a little more before this lovely     winter is over. Dec. 14 - It snowed 8 inches last night and the temperature     dropped to about 0 degrees. Shoveled the sidewalk and     driveway again. Shortly the snowplow came by and did his     trick again. Dec. 15 - Sold our car and bought a 4x4 Blazer so we could     get through the snow. Bought snow tires for the truck. Dec. 18 - Fell on my Ass on the ice in the driveway. $23.

00     to the chiropractor, but nothing was broken, thank God! The     damn sky is getting dark again. Dec. 19 - Still cold (-10 this a.

m.

) Icy roads making for     very tough driving. Slid into a guard rail with my wife's     car. Probably a $100.

00 damage or so. She's pissed-off. Dec. 20 - Had another 14 inches of the white shit last     night. More shoveling in store for me today. That damned     snowplow came by twice. Dec. 22 - We are assured of a white Christmas because     another 7 inches of that white shit fell today and with this     freezing weather it won't melt till August! Got all dressed     up to go out and shovel that shit again. (Boots, snowsuit,     jacket, scarf, earmuffs, gloves, etc.

..

) then got the urge to     pee. Dec 24 - If I ever catch the son-of-a-bitch that drives     that snowplow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls.     I think he hides around the corner and waits for me to     finish shovelling and then comes down the street 100 miles     an hour and throws that white shit everywhere. Dec. 25 - MERRY CHRISTMAS.

.. they predict 12 more inches of     the fucking white stuff tonight. Does anyone know how many     damned shovels full of snow 12 inches is? To hell with     Santa, he doesn't have to shovel that white shit. The     snowplow driver came by asking for a donation. I hit him     with my ice axe. Dec. 28 - We got 11 more inches. I must be going snowblind     or have a severe case of depression. Dec. 29 - The toilet froze and the roof is starting to     cave-in. If you go outside, don't eat the brown snow. Dec. 30 - I torched the damned house .

.. moving back to     Florida!

I have an ad in the paper lookingforsomeone to play my piano. Please sit down at the keyboard and play for meif you're interested."The guy does and as he plays the piano the owner is in awe of his talentand musical abilities. The owner says, "You play the piano more beautifullythan anyone I have ever heard! What is the name of that song?"The guy says, "I wrote that song and the name is Two Lesbians Fucking TheirBrains Out."The owner gasps and is taken back. He says, "My gosh, that's a terrible namefor such a beautiful song.  Do you know any others?"The guy smiles and plays again.

That night the guy was playing the piano and the crowd was just as amazedas the owner was with this man's musical abilities.  After playing twosongs the crowd stood up and applauded.

One of the patrons close to the piano says, "Sir, do you know your dick andballs are hanging out?"The guy smiles and says, "KNOW IT, I WROTE IT!"

One day, this man, Tony, died. When he was sent to be judged, he was told that he had committed a sin, and that he could not go to heaven right away. He asked what he did and God told him that he cheated on his income taxes, and that the only way he could get into heaven would be to sleep with a 500 pound, stupid, butt-ugly woman for the next five years and enjoy it. Tony decided that this was a small price to pay for an eternity in heaven. So off he went with this enormous woman, pretending to be happy.

As he was walking along, he saw his friend Carlos up ahead. Carlos was with an even bigger, uglier woman than he was with. When he approached Carlos he asked him what was going on, and Carlos replied, "I cheated on my income taxes and scammed the government out of a lot of money.

..

even more then you did." They both shook their heads in understanding and figured that as long as they have to be with these women, they might as well hang out together to help pass the time.

Now Tony, Carlos, and their two beastly women were walking along, minding their own business when Tony and Carlos could have sworn that they saw their friend Jon up ahead, only this man was with an absolutely drop dead gorgeous supermodel / centerfold. Stunned, Tony and Carlos approached the man and in fact it was their friend Jon. They asked him how is he with this unbelievable goddess, while they were stuck with these god-awful women.

Jon replied, "I have no idea, and I'm definitely not complaining. This has been absolutely the best time of my life (and I'm dead,

) and I have five years of the best sex any man could hope for to look forward to. There is only one thing that I can't seem to understand. After everytime we have sex, she rolls over and murmur's to herself, "Damn income taxes!"

A couple went on vacation to a resort up north. The husband liked to fish, and the wife liked to read. One morning the husband came back from fishing after getting up real early that morning and took a nap.

While he slept, the wife decided to take the boat out. She was not familiar with the lake, so she rowed out and anchored the boat, and started reading her book.

Along comes the Game Warden in his boat, pulls up alongside the woman's boat and asks her what she's doing? She says, "Reading my book."The Game Warden tells her she is in a restricted fishing area and she explains that she's not fishing. To which he replied, "But you have all this equipment. I will have to take you in and write you up!"Angry that the warden was being so unreasonable, the lady told the warden, "If you do that, I will charge you with rape."The warden, shocked by her statement, replied, "But I didn't even touch you."To which the lady replied, "Yes; but you have all the equipment!"

Three men: a philosopher, a mathematician and an idiot,

were out riding in the car when it crashed into a tree.

Before anyone knows it, the three men found themselvesstanding before the pearly gates of Heaven, where StPeter and the Devil were standing nearby."Gentlemen," the Devil started, "Due to the fact thatHeaven is now overcrowded, therefore St Peter has agreed tolimit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone ofyou can ask me a question which I don't know or cannotanswer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not,

then you'll come with me to Hell."The philosopher then stepped up, "OK, give me the mostcomprehensive report on Socrates' teachings," With a snapof his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil.

The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct."Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, thephilsopher disappeared.

The mathematician then asked, "Give me the most complicatedformula you can ever think of!" With a snap of his finger,

another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. Themathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it wascorrect. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of hisfinger, the mathematician disappeared, too.

The idiot then stepped forward and said, "Bring me achair!" The Devil brought forward a chair. "Drill 7 holeson the seat." The Devil did just that. The idiot then saton the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, heasked, "Which hole did my fart come out from?"The Devil inspected the seat and said, "The third hole fromthe right."

"Wrong," said the idiot, "it's from my asshole." Andthe idiot went to Heaven.

A photographer from a well known national magazine was assigned tocover the fires at Yellowstone National Park.

When the photographer arrived, he realized that the smoke was sothick that it would seriously impede or make it impossible for himto photograph anything from ground level. He requested permission torent a plane and take photos from the air.

He arrived at the airport and saw a plane warming up near the gate.

He jumped in with his bag and shouted, "Let's go!

CHOCOLATE By John Scalzi   Chocolate is God's way of reminding men how inadequate they are. I am   vividly confronted with this fact every time my wife and I go out to a   restaurant.   When it gets to dessert, my wife usually orders the most   chocolate-saturated dessert possible: It's the one called "Unstoppable   Double-Fudge Chocolate Mudslide Explosion" or some such thing. I   always wonder why anyone would want to eat anything that promises a   catastrophic natural disaster in your mouth.   The dark brown monstrosity arrives at the table, and my wife takes the   first bite. Before the fork is even removed from her mouth, a small   moan escapes her lips. Her eyes, previously perfectly aligned, first   cross slightly and then faze completely, pupils dilating in pure   chocolate pleasure before the eyelids clamp down in ecstasy. The hand   not holding the fork clenches into a fist and starts pounding the   table. The silverware rattles.   After about six minutes of this, she finally manages to swallow the   bite, realign her eyes, and take the next shuttle back from whatever   transcendental plane she's been visiting. Slowly, her sphere of   consciousness expands to include me, her husband, her life-long mate,   her presumed partner in all things ecstatic.   "Hey, this is pretty good," she'll say. "You want some?"   No, I don't. I want nothing to do with an object that does to my wife   in one bite what I've worked for an entire relationship to achieve. It   wouldn't do any good, anyway. Men just don't have the same   relationship with chocolate that women do. It's not even close. I   wandered around the office today and asked men -- "Chocolate. Your   thoughts?" -- and the result was always the same. First, a confused   look as to why they're being asked about something so trivial, and   then some lame, obvious statement: "Uh.

..

it's brown?"   Ask women the same question, and you get responses like "The ONLY food   group," "ESSENTIAL to life as we know it," and the ultimate casual   swipe at every member of the Y-chromosome brigade, "better than sex."   Ouch. Some women will try to make up for that last one by quickly   adding that chocolate is supposed to be an aphrodisiac.   Uh-huh. Chocolate certainly increases desire; problem is the desire is   usually for more chocolate. The best a guy can do is buy a box of   chocolates and hope he'll be considered somewhere between the cherry   truffle and the strawberry nougat.   Don't get me wrong. Guys like chocolate just fine; it's just not   essential to life as we know it.   Respiration is essential to life as we know it; chocolate is simply   one of those nice little bonuses you get. We won't usually pass it up   if it's offered, but I don't know too many guys who would get   substantially worked up if it were to suddenly disappear from the face   of the earth (ironic in a way, as back in the days of the Aztecs, only   men were allowed to have the stuff). When I eat a chocolate dessert, I   enjoy it, yes. My world view doesn't narrow to include only the plate   that it's on.   Maybe we're missing something. On the other hand, we don't have to   pick up our silverware from the floor after we're done with our   tiramisu. Life is about trade-offs like that. All I know is that come   Valentine's Day, chocolate will be among the things I offer my wife. I   can't truly appreciate it, but I can truly appreciate what it does for   her. Which is close enough.   copyright(c) John Scalzi   John Scalzi is a columnist and humorist living in Virginia. For more   columns and essays, visit his website: www.

One year at halloween the governor was giving a costume party.  All the gentry were there and as they arrived the doorman would announce what there characters were.

When one couple arrived he announced "Mickey and Minnie Mouse".

As the next couple arrived he announced "Tarzan and Jane" and so on as each guest arrived.

Later in the evening a man arrived dressed only in a pair of underpants but apart from that totally naked from head to toe."Who do you think you are?" demanded the doorman.  Having ascertained that the man was indeed an invited guest from the local university CS department The doorman asked "How shall I announce you?"The man said, "I'm premature ejaculation"

"I'm very sorry sir", said the doorman in obvious shock, "I cannot announce anything like that to such a gathering."

"O.

Holiday Party Festivity LevelsLevel I:      Your guests are conversing quietly, nibbling at their hors d'oerves,     and sipping their drinks. Later, some of the gather by the piano to     sing carols while others admire the ornaments on your tree. Level II:      Your guests are talking loudly, wolfing hors d'oerves, and drinking     from the bottles. Some people gather by the piano to sing "I Gotta     Be Me" while others begin rearranging your ornaments. Level III:      Your guests are arguing wildly among themselves, those that haven't     passed out from the upside-down margaritas. One person is singing     "I Can't Get No Satisfaction", which can barely be heard over the     sound of breaking ornaments. A small group of guests begin placing     hors d'oerves in the piano to see what happens when the little     hammers strike. Level IV:      Your guests, hors d'oerves smeared over their naked bodies, are     performing a ritualistic dance around the burning Christmas tree.     The piano is missing. In general, you want to keep your party around Level III, unless you rentyour home, have insurance, and are carrying firearms. The quickest way toget to Level III is egg-nog.

Diary EntriesAUG. 12   Moved to our new home in Ohio.  It is so beautiful here.  Thehills are so majestic.  I can hardly wait to see them with snow coveringthem.  I love it here.

OCT. 14   Ohio is the most beautiful place on Earth.  The leaves are turnedall the colors and shades of red and orange.  Went for a ride through thebeautiful hills and saw some deer.  They are so graceful, certainly theyare the most wonderful animal on Earth.  This must be paradise.  I love ithere.

NOV. 11   Deer season will start soon.  I can't imagine anyone wanting tokill such a gorgeous creature.  Hope it will snow soon,  I love it here.

DEC. 2  It snowed last night.  Woke up to find everything blanketed inwhite.  It looks like a postcard.  We went outside and cleaned the snow offthe steps and shoveled the driveway.  We had a snowball fight (I won), andwhen the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again.  What abeautiful place.  I love Ohio. DEC. 12  More snow last night.  I love it.  The snowplow did his trickagain to the driveway.  I love it here.

DEC. 19  More snow last night.  Couldn't get out of the driveway to get towork.  I am exhausted from shoveling.  Fucking snowplow.

DEC. 22  More of that white shit fell last night.  I've got blisters on myhands from shoveling.  I think the snowplow hides around the corner andwaits till I'm done shoveling.  Asshole.

DEC. 25  Merry Fucking Christmas!  More friggen snow.  If I ever get myhands on that sonofabitch who drives that snowplow, I swear I'll kill thebastard.  Don't know why they don't use more salt on the roads to melt thefucking ice.

DEC. 27  More of that White Shit last night.  Been inside for 3 days exceptfor shoveling out the driveway after that snowplow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, cars stuck in a mountain of that White Shit.  Theweatherman says to expect another 10" of the shit again tonight.  Do youknow how many shovels full 10" of snow is?

DEC. 28  The fucking weatherman was Wrong.  We got 34" of that white shitthis time.  At this rate it won't melt before the middle of next summer. The snowplow got stuck up the road and that bastard came to the door andasked to borrow my shovel.  After I told him I had broken six shovelsalready shovelling the white shit he pushed into my driveway, I broke mylast one right over his Fuckin' Head!

JAN. 4  Finally got out of the house today.  Went to the store to get foodand on the way back damned deer ran out in front of the car and I hit it. Did about $3000.

00 worth of damage to the car.  Those fucking beasts shouldbe killed.  Wished the hunters had got them all last November.

MAY 3  Took the car to the garage in town.  Would you believe themotherfucker is rusting out from all the goddamn salt they put on theroads?

MAY 10  Moved to Florida.  I can't imagine anyone in their right mindwanting to live in the God-forsaken state of Ohio.

A fellow was shipwrecked with six lovely women whoin a short time were fighting over his attentions.

They held a meeting to resolve the problem anddecided that each would have his services on adifferent day of the week, with Sundays off for him. In due time the guy was dragging himself through theweek, looking forward to Sunday. As he lay an the beach one day he saw a dot floatingon the sea which as it got closer turned out to be aman on a raft. With his last ounce of strength heswam out, pulled the raft ashore, gave the occupantCPR and as he came around said to him; "Oh man, amI ever glad to see you! "Goodness gracious, am I ever glad to see you too"said the raft rider in a swishy way.

With a shrug of resignation the guy said.

.. "Oh damn,

there goes my Sundays!"

Three men die in a car accident on Christmas Eve. They all find themselves at the Pearly Gates waiting to enter Heaven. On entering, they are told that they must present something with a flavor in order to get in.

The first man searches his pocket, and finds some pine needles from the family's Christmas tree. He is allowed entry to Heaven.

The second man offers a bow and some ribbon, from presents that were opened earlier that evening. He too is allowed entry to Heaven.

The third man reaches into his pocket and produces a pair of panties.

Confused at the man's gesture, St. Peter asks, "How do panties represent Christmas?"The man replies, "Oh, they're Carol's."

Texas insurance agent.

Attorney: "At the scene of the accident, did you tell the constable you had never felt better in your life?"Farmer: "That's right."Attorney: "Well, then, how is it that you are now claiming you were seriously injured when my client's auto hit your wagon?"Farmer: "When the constable arrived, he went over to my horse,

I just  thought under the circumstances, it was a wise choice of wordsto say  I've never felt better in my life.

How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?        Such number as may be deemed to perform the stated task in a        timely and efficient manner within the strictures of the follow-        ing agreement:        Whereas the party of the first part, also known as "The Lawyer",        and the party of the second part, also known as "The Light Bulb",        do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party        of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed from the current        position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon        duties, i.

e.

, the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumina-        tion of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the        entry way, terminating at an area just inside the primary living        area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover        illumination being at the option of the party of the second part        (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement be-        tween the parties.        The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be        limited to, the following steps:        1.

) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without        elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or        any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part        (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb)        in a counter-clockwise direction, said direction being non-        negotiable.  Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second        part (Light Bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first        part (Lawyer) with every possible caution by the party of the        first part (Lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the        party of the second part (Light Bulb), notwithstanding the afore-        mentioned failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) to        perform the aforementioned customary and agreed upon duties. The        foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that        structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb)        may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and        in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held        blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement        is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil        (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part        (Lawyer) throughout.        2.

) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part        (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part        ("Receptacle"), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have        the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light        Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local        and federal statutes.        3.

) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party        of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning        installation of the party of the fourth part("New Light Bulb").        This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the        reverse of the procedures described in step one of this self-        same document, being careful to note that the rotation should        occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-        negotiable.        NOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the option        of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the        first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all        persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to        produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of        the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with        maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth        part, also known as "The Firm".

A big-city lawyer was representing the railroad in a lawsuit filed by an old rancher. The rancher's prize bull was missing from the section through which the railroad passed. The rancher only wanted to be paid the fair value of the bull. The case was scheduled to be tried before the justice of the peace in the back room of the general store. The city-slicker attorney for the railroad immediately cornered the rancher and tried to get him to settle out of court. He did his best selling job, and finally the rancher agreed to take half of what he was asking. After the rancher had signed the release and took the check, the young lawyer couldn't resist gloating a little over his success, telling the rancher, "You are really a country hick, old man, but I put one over on you in there. I couldn't have won the case. The engineer was asleep and the fireman was in the caboose when the train went through your ranch that morning. I didn't have one witness to put on the stand. I bluffed you!" The old rancher replied, "Well, I'll tell you young feller, I was a little worried about winning that case myself, because that durned bull came home this morning."

A very religious man lived right next door to an atheist. While the religious one prayed day in, day out, and was constantly on his knees in communion with his Lord, the atheist never even looked twice at a church.

However, the atheist's life was good, he had a well-paying job and a beautiful wife, and his children were healthy and good-natured, whereas the pious man's job was strenuous and his wages were low, his wife was getting fatter every day and his kids wouldn't give him the time of the day.

So one day, deep in prayer as usual, he raised his eyes towards heaven and asked:"Oh God, I honour you every day, I ask your advice for every problem and confess to you my every sin. Yet my neighbour, who doesn't even believe in you and certainly never prays, seems blessed with every happiness, while I go poor andsuffer many an indignity. Why is this?"And a great voice was heard from above:"BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BOTHER ME ALL THE TIME!"

Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell. She immediately called Saint Peter and said, "This is Sister Margaret. There's been a terrible mistake!" She explained the situation, and Saint Peter said he'd get right onit. The next day the nun didn't hear from Saint Peter so she called him again. "Please set this error straight before tomorrow," she begged. "There's an orgy planned for tonight, and everyone *must* attend!" "Of course, Sister," he said. "I'll get you out of there right away." Apparently, her plight slipped his mind, and the following morning Saint Peter received another phone call from hell. He picked up the receiver with tribulations of his heart and started to listen.

He heard the following, "Hey, Pete, this is Maggie. Never mind!"

Preserving the Egg of LifeObviously, Football is a syndrome of religious rites symbolizing thestruggle to preserve the Egg of Life through the rigors of impendingwinter.  The rites begin at the Autumn Equinox and culminate on thefirst day of the New Year, with great festivals identified with bowlsof plenty.  The festivals are associated with flowers such as roses;fruits such as oranges; farm crops such as cotton; and even sun-worshipand appeasement of great reptiles such as alligators.

In these rites, the Egg of Life is symbolized by what is called"The Oval", an inflated bladder covered with hog skin.  The conventionof "The Oval" is repeated in the architectural oval-shaped design ofthe vast outdoor churches in which the services are held every sabbathin every town and city.  Also every Sunday in the greater centers ofpopulation where an advanced priesthood performs.  These enormouschurches dominate every college campus; no other edifice compares insize with them, and they bear witness to the high spiritual developmentof the culture that produced them.

Literally millions of worshipers attend the sabbath services in theseopen-air churches.  Subconsciously, these hordes are seeking an outletfrom sexual frustration in anticipation of violent masochism and sadismabout to be enacted by a highly trained priesthood of young men.  Footballobviously arises out of the Oedipus complex.  Love of mother dominatesthe entire ritual.  (Notre Dame and Football are synonymous).

The rites are preformed on a green rectangular area  orientated to thefour directions.  The green area, symbolizing Summer, is striped withominous white lines representing the knifing snows of Winter.  Thewhite stripes are repeated in the ceremonial costumes of the fourwhistling monitors who control the services through a time perioddivided into four quarters, symbolizing the four Seasons.

The ceremony begins with colorful processions of musicians and semi-nudevirgins who move in and out of ritualized patterns.  This excites thethousands of worshipers to rise from their seats, shout frenzied poetryin unison and chant ecstatic anthems through which runs the Oedipustheme of willingness to die for the love of mother.

The actual rites, performed by 22 young priests of perfect physique,

might appear to the uninitiated as a chaotic conflict concerned onlywith hurting the Oval by kicking it, then endeavoring to rescue andprotect the Egg.

However, the procedure is highly stylized.  On each side there areeleven young men wearing colorful and protective costumes.  The groupin so-called "possession" of the Oval first arrange themselves in anegg-shaped "huddle," as it is called, for a moment of prayerfulmeditation and whispering of secret numbers to each other.

Then they rearrange themselves with relation to the position of theEgg.  In a typical "formation" there are seven priests "on the line,"seven being a mystical number associated not, as Jung purists mightcontend, with the "seven last words" but actually, with sublimationof the "seven deadly sins" into "the seven cardinal principles ofeducation."The central priest crouches over the Egg, protecting it with hishands, while over his back quarters hovers the "Quarterback."  Thetransposition of "back quarters" to "quarterback" is easilyexplained by the Adler School.  To the layman the curious postureassumed by the "Quarterback," as he hovers over the central priest,

immediately suggests the Cretan origins of Mycenaean animal art,

but this popular view is untenable.  Actually, of course, the"quarter-back" symbolizes the libido, combining two instincts,

namely, a) Eros, which strives for even closer union, and b) theinstinct for destruction of anything which lies in the path of Eros.

Moreover, the "pleasure-pain" excitement of the hystericalworshipers focuses entirely on the actions of the libido-quarter-back.

Behind him are three priests representing the male triad.

At a given signal, the Egg is passed by sleight-of-hand to one ofthe members of the triad who endeavors to move it by bodily forceacross the white lines of Winter.  This procedure up and down theenclosure, continues through the four quarters of the ritual.

At the end of the second quarter, implying the Summer Slostice, theprocessions of musicians and semi-nude virgins are resumed.  Afterforming themselves into pictograms representing alphabetical andanimal fetishes, the virgins perform a most curious rite requiringfar more dexterity than the earlier phallic Maypole rituals fromwhich it seems to be derived.  Each of the virgins carries a wandof shining metal which she spins on her fingertips, tosses playfullyinto the air, and with which she interweaves her body in mostintricate gyrations.

The virgins perform another important function throughout the entireservice.  This concerns the mystical rite of "conversion" followingsuccess of one of the young priests in carrying the Oval across thelast white line of Winter.  As the moment of "conversion" approaches,

the virgins kneel at the edge of the rectangle, bury their faces inthe earth, then raise their arms to heaven in supplication, prayingthat "the uprights will be split."  "Conversion" is indeed adedicated ceremony.

The Naming of JesusA group of biblical scholars were involved in a heated discussion about how Jesus of Nazareth was named. How did he become known as the Messiah, or Christ. One of the scholars argued that the name was a Greek corruption of Aramaic, and purists and fundamentalists ought to use the name Joshua. Another argued that Joshua was Hebrew, not Aramaic, to which a third argued that Hebrew should be used because Jesus was said to be the King of the Jews. The debate went on and on and became more and more sophisticated and obtuse. Finally, an old man known for his wisdom intervened. He informed the group that he knew how Jesus was named. When Jesus was born, a star shown in the sky, and three wise men from the East travelled to Bethlehem. They had travelled for days, suffered great deprivation, and when they finally got to Bethlehem got lost trying to find the manger. Finally, after much ado, and in rather foul moods, they reached the manger and entered the stall. As one of them came through the door, he tripped on the door sill, and fell into the wall hitting his head. "Jesus Christ!" he screamed, andthat is how the baby was named.

Love Jesus                                  by Dennis DiPasquale                       The other day I went to the local religious book store,                where I saw a HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker. I bought it                 and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I                did. What an uplifting experience followed.  I was stopped at the                  light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the                 Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper                  sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus.                Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY                 love the lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and                   yelled, "Jesus Christ!

!" as loud as he could. It was like a                    football game with him shouting, "GO JESUS CHRIST,

GO!

!!"                Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and                 waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have                   been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him                 yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a                   funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.                     I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed,                    looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the                Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him                 the good luck sign back. Several cars behind, a very nice black                man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn't hear                    him very well, but it sounded like, "Mother trucker," or                 "Mother's from there." Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must                really love the lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in                 the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were                  walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I                noticed that the light had changed, and stepped on the gas. And a                good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the                intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way                 out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian                    good luck sign, as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such                                        wonderful folks.

Three Reform Rabbis were in a terrible auto wreck. None survived. One minute they were driving along the highway, talking and laughing and joking, and the next, BOOM! they were before the Creator of all. Shaking his head, The Omnipotent One looks at the three. "Reform I can understand. But where will it end? You! Goldblum! The ashtrays in your temple so My people could smoke while the Torah was being read?

??"Goldblum shuddered.

God went on. "I can live with that. Men are weak, but the Word is strong!" Goldblum sighed with relief. "Bauman! Really, I can accept My people need to eat, but really: serving Ham Sandwiches to the devout at the temple during Yom Kippur?" Bauman hung his head in shame. "Even that I can allow to pass, even with the eating of that which is not Kosher. I'm not pleased at all with the playing fast and loose with my people, but I can accept these indiscretions."Bauman also heaved a sigh of relief.

Finally, He turns to the third rabbi and says, "You, Rabinowitz, have gone too far! Am I asking too much? No, you flaunt the world at Me, even on the holiest days of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur by putting out a sign saying.

..

. "Closed for the Holiday !

One day Mrs. Jones went to have a talk with the minister at the local church. "Reverend," she said, "I have a problem--my husband keeps falling asleep during your sermons. It's very embarrassing. What should I do?"    "I have an idea," said the minister. "Take this hatpin with you. I will be able to tell when Mr. Jones is sleeping, and I will motion to you at specific times. When I motion, you give him a good poke in the leg."    In church the following Sunday, Jones dozed off. Noticing this, the preacher put his plan to work. "And who lay made the ultimate sacrifice for you?" he said, nodding to Mrs. Jones. "Jesus!" Jones cried as his wife jabbed him the leg with the hatpin.  "Yes, you are right, Mr. Jones," said the minister.  Soon, Jones nodded off again. Again, the minister noticed."Who is your redeemer?" he asked the congregation, motioning towards Mrs. Jones.  "God!" Jones cried out as he was stuck again with the hatpin.  "Right again," said the minister, smiling.   Before long, Jones again winked off. However, this time the minister did not notice. As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few motions that Mrs. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet her husband with the hatpin again. The minister asked, "And what did Eve say to Adam after she bore him his last son?" Mrs. Jones poked her husband, who yelled, "You stick that goddamned thing in me one more time and I'll break it off and shove it up your ass!"

Recently a teacher, a garbage collector, and a lawyer wound up together at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, "What was the name of the ship that crashed into theiceberg? They just made a movie about it." The teacher answered quickly, "That would be the Titanic." St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didn't REALLY need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder: "How many people died on the ship?" Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie and answered, "about 1,

500." "That's right! You may enter." St. Peter then turned to the lawyer. "Name them."

As soon   as the Associate Pastor left the room, Father Norton headed out of   town to a golf course about forty miles away. This way he knew he   wouldn't accidentally meet anyone he knew from his parish.   Setting up on the first tee, he was alone. After all, it was Sunday   morning and everyone else was in church! At about this time, Saint   Peter leaned over to the Lord while looking down from the heavens and   exclaimed, "You're not going to let him get away with this, are you?"   The Lord sighed, and said, "No, I guess not." Just then Father Norton   hit the ball and it shot straight towards the pin, dropping just short   of it, rolled up and fell into the hole. It WAS A 420 YARD HOLE IN   ONE! St. Peter was astonished. He looked at the Lord and asked, "Why   did you let him do that?" The Lord smiled and replied, "Who's he going   to tell?"

Moses, Jesus and an old man are golfing. Moses steps up to   the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands   in the water trap. Moses parts the water and chips the ball onto the   green.   Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the   fairway and lands in the water trap.   Jesus just walks on the water and chips the ball onto the green. The   old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over   the fairway and heads for the water trap. But, just before it falls   into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth.

As the   fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down and   grabs the fish in its claws. The eagle flies over the green where a   lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, the   eagle drops the fish. When the fish hits the ground, the ball pops out   of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one.   Jesus then turns to the old man and says, "Dad, if you don't stop   fooling around, we won't bring you next time."

God created the mule, and told him, 'you will be Mule, workingconstantly from dusk to dawn, carrying heavy loads on your back. You will eat grass and you lack intelligence. You will live for 50 years. The mule answered: 'To live like this for 50 years is too much. Please, give me no more than 20.

Then God created the dog, and told him, 'you will hold vigilanceover the dwellings of Man, to him you will be his greatest companion.  Youwill eat his table scraps and live for 25 years.

'And the dog responded, 'Lord, to live 25 years as a dog is too much.

Please, no more than 10 years.

' And it was so. God then created the monkey, and told him, 'You are Monkey.  You shall swing from tree to tree, acting like an idiot. You will be funny,

and you shall live for 20 years.

'And the monkey responded, 'Lord, to live 20 years as the  clown of theworld is too much. Please, Lord, give me  no more than 10 years.

'  And it was so.

Finally, God created Man and told him, 'You are Man, the only rationalbeing that walks the earth.  You will use your intelligence to havemastery over the creatures of the world. You will dominate the earth andlive for 20 years.

And the man responded, 'Lord, to be Man for only 20 years is toolittle. Please, Lord, give me the 20 years the mule refused, the 15 yearsthe dog refused, and the ten years the monkey rejected.

And so God made Man to live 20 years as a man, then marry and live20 years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back.  Then, he is to  have children and live 15 years as a dog, guarding his house andeating the leftovers after they empty the pantry then, in his old age, to live 10 years as a monkey, acting like a clown to amuse his grandchildren.

The following day, mealtime arrived and another can of tuna was opened. Meekly, Seymour said, "Lord, I am very happy to be be in heaven as a reward for the good life I lived. But, this is heaven, and all I get to eat is tuna. But in the Other Place, they eat like Kings. I just don't understand." "To be honest, Seymour," the Lord said, "for just two people, does it pay to cook?"

"I think so," the man replied.  "My wife has made appetizers and we have a caterer coming to provide plenty of cookies and cakes for all of our guests."

"I don't mean that," the priest responded.  "I mean, are you preparedspiritually?"

"Oh, sure," came the reply.  "I've got a keg of beer and a case of whiskey."

This fundamentalist Christian couple felt it important to own an equallyfundamentally Christian pet.  So, they went shopping.

At a kennel specializing in this particular breed, they found a dog theyliked quite a lot.  When they asked the dog to fetch the Bible, he did it in a flash.  When they instructed him to look up Psalm 23, he complied equally fast, using his paws with dexterity.  They were impressed, purchased the animal, and went home (piously, of course).

That night they had friends over.  They were so proud of their newfundamentalist dog and his major skills, they called the dog and showed off a little.

The friends were impressed, and asked whether the dog was able to do any of the usual dog tricks, as well.  This stopped the couple cold, as they hadn't thought about "normal"  tricks.

Well, they said, "let's try this out."Once more they called the dog, and they clearly pronounced the command,"Heel!"Quick as a wink, the dog jumped up, put his paw on the man's forehead,

closed his eyes in concentration, and bowed his head.

Easter is approaching. Father O'Maley checks estimates for the flowerdecoration of the altar.

The catholic florist - $ 300. "Too expensive" moans the priest.

The protestant florist - $ 250, "No, it would not be right to buy atanother Christian believer, especially as the price difference is rather small." But lo! Solly Goldberg - $ 75!

Religion or economics? After much consideration, Solly obtains thecontract.

On Easter Sunday morning, Goldberg's men deliver the flowers: wonderfulroses, azaleas, camellias, tulips and carnations. O'Maley's last reservations are discarded.

When the parishioners arrive in the church, they see the magnificentflower arrangement and a ribbon with the inscription:"Jesus has risen! But the prices of Goldberg always stay the same."

A game warden came upon a duck hunter who had bagged 3   ducks and decided to "enforce the laws pending." He stopped the   hunter, flashed his badge and said, "Looks like you've had a pretty   good day. Mind if I inspect your kill?" The hunter shrugged and handed   the ducks to the warden. The warden took one of the ducks, inserted   his finger into the duck's rectum, pulled it out, sniffed it, and   said, "This here's a Washington state duck. Do you have a Washington   state hunting license?" The hunter pulled out his wallet and calmly   showed the warden a Washington state hunting license. The warden took   a second duck, inserted his finger in the bird's rectum, pulled it   out, sniffed it, and said, "This here's an Idaho duck. Do you have an   Idaho state hunting license?" The hunter, a bit put out, produced an   Idaho state hunting license. The warden took a third duck, conducted   the same finger test, and said, "This here's an Oregon state duck. Do   you have an Oregon state hunting license?" Once again, only this time   more aggravated, the hunter produced the appropriate license. The   warden, a little miffed at having struck out, handed the ducks back to   the hunter and said, "You've got all of these licenses, just where the   hell are you from?" The hunter dropped his pants, bent over, and said   "You're so smart, YOU tell ME!"

A man was driving along the highway, and saw a rabbit   hopping across the middle of the road. He swerved to avoid hitting the   rabbit, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of the car and   was hit. The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover,   pulled over to the side of the road, and got out to see what had   become of the rabbit. Much to his dismay, the rabbit was dead. The   driver felt so awful, he began to cry. A woman driving down the   highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over.   She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong. "I feel   terrible," he explained, "I accidentally hit this rabbit and killed   it." The woman told the man not to worry. She knew what to do. She   went to her car trunk, and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to   the limp, dead rabbit, and sprayed the contents of the can onto the   rabbit. Miraculously the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved its paw   at the two humans and hopped down the road. 50 yards away the rabbit   stopped, turned around, waved and hopped down the road, another 50   yards, turned, waved and hopped another 50 yards. The man was   astonished. He couldn't figure out what substance could be in the   woman's spray can!

! He ran over to the woman and asked, "What is in   your spray can? What did you spray on that rabbit?" The woman turned   the can around so that the man could read the label. It said: "Hair   spray. Restores life to dead hair. Adds permanent wave."

I HAD A BAD DAY   It was getting a little crowded in Heaven, so God decided to change   the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into   Heaven, you had to have a really bad day the day you died. The policy   would go into effect at noon the following day. So the next day at   12:01 the first person came to the gates of Heaven.   The angel at the gate, remembering about the new law, promptly told   the man, "Before I can let you in, I need you to tell me about the day   you died."   "No problem." said the man. "Well, for some time now, I've thought my   wife was having an affair. I believed that each day on her lunch hour,   she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex   with him. So today I was going to come home too and catch them. Well,   I got there and busted in and immediately began searching for this   guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire   apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just as I was going to   give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that   there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of   that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and   promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground.   But wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall   and he didn't die. This pissed me off even more, so in a rage I went   back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at   him. And oddly enough, the first thing I could grab was the   refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and   heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him!   The excitement of the moment was so great that right after that I had   a heart attack and died almost instantly."   The angel sat back and though for a moment. Technically, the guy DID   have a bad day, and it was a crime of passion, so he announced, "OK,   Sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven," and let him in.   A few seconds later the next guy came up. "OK, here's the rule. Before   I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died."   "Sure thing" the man replied. "But you're not gonna believe this. I   was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily   exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over   the side! Luckily however, I was able to catch myself by my fingertips   on the balcony directly beneath mine. When all of a sudden this crazy   man comes running out of his apartment and starts cussing and stomping   on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on   the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I'm   laying there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating   pain, I see the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the   ledge and it falls directly on top of me and kills me!"   The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his   story. "I could get used to this new policy," he thinks to himself.   "Very well," the angel announces. "Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,"   and he lets the man enter.   A few seconds later the third man in line comes up to the gate. "Tell   me about the day you died," said the angel.   "OK, picture this, " says the man. "I'm naked inside a   Refrigerator.

The Programmer asks the firstquestion. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The Engineerdoesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollarbill and hands it to the Programmer.

Now, it's the Engineer's turn. He asks the Programmer "What goes up a hillwith three legs, and comes down on four?"The Programmer looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptopcomputer and searches all of his references. He taps into the Airphone withhis modem and searches the net and the Library of Congress.

Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his co-workers -- all to no avail.

After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50. The Engineerpolitely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get back to sleep.

The Programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the Engineer and asks"Well, so what's the answer?"Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the Programmer$5, and turns away to get back to sleep.

They crept up from an advantageous direction like a couple of commandos, pushed the outhouse over on one side and headed for the woods. They circled round and returned home an hour later from a completely different direction thus, trying to divert suspicion from themselves.

Upon returning, their father approached them with switch in hand and bellowed, "Did you two push the outhouse over this afternoon?"The older boy replied, "As learned in school, I cannot tell a lie. Yes, Father, we pushed over the outhouse this afternoon."At this revalation, the farmer proceeded to flail the two boys severely and sent them to bed without supper.

get her into a rehab clinic. Your wife's pregnant,

it's not yours,

get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, Your tennis elbow will never get better!

He tries to get it out, but succeeds only in forcing the thing in awfully deep.

After a few hours of fruitless rooting the couple decide to go to thehospital, but on their way out of the front door they meet their daughter coming in with her boyfriend.

The boyfriend takes control of the situation; he tells them he's studying medicine and that they're not to worry about a thing.  Hethen sticks two fingers up the man's nose and asks him to blow, andlow and behold, the nut shoots from the ear and out across the room.

As the daughter and her boyfriend go through to the kitchen to get drinks, the man and his wife sit down to discuss their luck."So" the wife says, "what do you think he'll become after he finishesschool? A GP or a surgeon?"                                                   "Well," says the man, rubbing his nose, "by the smell of his fingers,                                                   I think he's likely to be our son-in-law."

Againshe tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover shestill couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed she once againreached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and fora second time attempted the step and once again, much to herchagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.

So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzippedthe offending skirt to give a little more slack and again wasunable to make the step.

About this time the big Texan that was behind her in the linepicked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly onthe step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be heroscreeching at him "How dare you touch my body!

! I don't evenknow who you are!" At this the Texan drawled "Well ma'am normally I would agreewith you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kindafigured that we was friends."

Joan, a rather well-proportioned & near-sighted secretary, spent almost all of her vacation sunbathing on the roof of her hotel. She wore a bathing suit the first few days, but always removed her glasses for an even facial tan. After several days she decided that no one could see her way up there, so she slipped out of her suit for an overall tan. She'd hardly begun when she heard someone running up the stairs; she was lying on her stomach, so she just pulled a towel over her rear. "Excuse me, miss," said the flustered little assistant manager of the hotel, out of breath from running up the stairs. "The hotel doesn't mind your sunbathing on the roof, but we would very much appreciate your wearing a bathing suit as you have for the past week." "What difference does it make?" Joan asked rather calmly. "No one can see me up here, and besides, I'm covered with a towel." "Not exactly," said the embarrassed little man. "You're lying on the dining room skylight!"

I could hardly concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in."Mrs. Smith leaned forward. "You mean squirrels actually chewed on your, um.

A successful businessman flew to Vegas for a weekend to gamble. He lostthe shirt off his back and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round-trip air ticket. If he could just get to the airport he could get himself home. So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting.

He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised tosend the driver money from home, offering his credit card numbers,

his driver's license number and his address but to no avail. The cabbie said, "If you don't have $15, get the hell out of my cab."So the businessman was forced to hitchhike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight.

One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regainhis financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of thecasino to get a cab back to the airport. Well, who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs,

but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. The businessman thought for a moment about how he couldmake the guy pay for his lack of charity and he hit on a plan. The businessman got in the first cab in the line. "How much for a rideto the airport?" he asked. "Fifteen bucks," came the reply. "And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?" "What?

!! Get the hell out of my cab!"The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result. When he got to hisold friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, "How muchfor a ride to the airport?" The cabbie replied, "Fifteen bucks."The businessman said "OK" and off they went. Then, as they drove slowly past the long line of cabs, the businessmangave a big smile and thumbs-up sign to each driver.

At Heathrow Airport in England, a 300-foot red carpet was stretchedout to Air Force One and President Bush strode to a warm but dignifiedhandshake from Queen Elizabeth II.

They rode in a silver 1934 Bentley to the edge of central London wherethey boarded an open 17th century coach hitched to six magnificentwhite horses.

As they rode toward Buckingham Palace, each looking to their side andwaving to the thousands of cheering Britons lining the streets, allwas going well. This was indeed a glorious display of pageantry anddignity.

Suddenly the scene was shattered when the right rear horse let rip themost horrendous, earth-shattering, eye-smarting blast of flatulence,

and the coach immediately filled with noxious fumes.

Uncomfortable, but maintaining control, the two dignitaries did theirbest to ignore the whole incident, but then the Queen decided that wasa ridiculous manner with which to handle a most embarrassingsituation.

She turned to Mr. Bush and explained, "Mr. President, please accept myregrets. I'm sure you understand that there are some things even aQueen cannot control."George W.

, ever the Texas gentleman, replied, "Your Majesty, pleasedon't give the matter another thought. You know, if you hadn't saidsomething I would have assumed it was one of the horses."

A rather well proportioned young lady, Joan, spent almost all of her vacation sunbathing on the roof of the hotel.

She wore a bathing suit the first day but, on the second, being a naturist, she decided that no one could see her way up there, and she slipped out of it for an overall tan.

She'd hardly begun when she heard someone running up the stairs. She was lying on her stomach, so she just pulled a towel over her rear."Excuse me, miss," said the flustered little assistant manager of the hotel, out of breath from running up the stairs."The hotel doesn't mind you sunbathing on the roof but we would very much appreciate you wearing a bathing suit as you did yesterday."

"What difference does it make," Joan asked rather calmly."No one can see me up here, and besides, I'm covered with a towel."

"Not exactly," said the embarrassed little man. "You're lying on the dining room skylight."

"Aren't you going to answer that?" sayshis wife. So he drags himself out of bed, and goes downstairs. He opensthe door and there is man standing at the door. It didn't take thehomeowner long to realize the man was drunk."Hi there." slurs the stranger, "Can you give me a push?

?" "No, getlost, it's half past three. I was in bed." says the man and slams thedoor.

He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says "Dave, that wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke downin the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the baby-sitterand you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? Whatwould have happened if he'd told us to get lost?

?"

"But the guy was drunk." says the husband."It doesn't matter." says the wife. "He needs our help and it would bethe right thing to do."So the husband out of bed again, gets dressed, and goes downstairs. Heopens the door, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts:"Hey, do you still want a push?

?" and he hears a voice cry out "Yeah please."So, still being unable to see the stranger he shouts: "Where are you?"And the stranger replies: "I'm over here, on your swing."

On her way down the highway, holding her husbands penis in her hand, she decided to throw it out the window. She opened her window and tossed the penis as far as she could and sped away again. Meanwhile two potheads who were driving down the same highway happened to cross right by Lorenna just as she tossed it out the window and the penis hit their windshield smack dab in the middle. Stunned but still quiet the two locals drove on. About three miles down the road one pothead turned to the other and said, "Man, Did you see the size of the dick on the Mosquito?"

Standardized Guide to the Bases        Do you remember middle school/junior high/high school?

If so, do you remember talking about 'the bases' with your friends?"Yeah man, at the dance, X and Y went behind the gym and they got tosecond base!"Well that was cool and all, but what the hell was secondbase? Tongue kissing?  Up the shirt? Noone was really sure. Also, thebases tended to get progressively more intense as you got older. What's aperson to do?

Here, we mourn the passing of using baseball ananlogies to describesexual activity.  But let's face it, there are more than four stages intodays day and age of sex play.  So, in the interests of both bringingbaseball sex metaphors in line with the complications of modern romanceand with standardizing the bases, we present the Standardized Guide to theBases.

First, let's examine what the bases could have meant in the old days. --First Base-  This was almost always kissing, although one guyI knew thought it meant holding hands.  Sometimes it was tonguekissing and sometimes not.

--Second Base-  Variously this meant tongue kissing, breast feeling, oroutside the clothes genital contact.

--Third Base-  Usually this was a hand down the pants of you or yourpartner.

--Home Run-  This was ALWAYS sex, although it was rarely reached inthe times when you had to refer to it in terms of bases.

Well that system is ok, if you are a young teenager with a repressedsex drive.  But what happens when you reach maturity and new factors enterthe equation, such as oral sex?  And what about the exact definitions?

Well we have attempted to answer such puzzling questions and present withoutfurther ado.

..                          Standardized Guide to the Bases!

--On Deck-  Having plans for a date--Strike-Out-  Duh!

!

--Walk-  Kissing--Bunt-  Masturbation--Single-  Tongue kissing--Double-  Breasts/chest touched, some clothes off, lots of  grabbing and feels--Triple-  Most of the clothes off, genital contact, mutual  masturbation--Inside the park home run-  Oral Sex--Home Run-  SEX!

--Ground Rule Double-  would have sex, but no condom--Error-  Condom breaks during sex--Banned for life for gambling-  sex without condom--Hall of Fame-  Marriage       Now that we've got the basics, let's introduce some terms tobetter explain all the things that can happen now a days.

--Balk-  Premature ejaculation--Pine Tar- KY jelly--Relief pitcher-  Vibrator--Rain Delay-  parents/roommate return home unexpectedly--Box Seats-  Waterbed--Seventh Inning Stretch-  Unusual positions--Rookie-  Virgin--Minor Leagues-  Under 18--Loaded Bases-  manage a trois--Grand Slam-  Sex three times in twelve hours--Foul tip-  VD--Three up and three down-  impotencyNow that we have the definitions, lets quickly contrastthe old confusion with current clarity.

OLD WAY- we um got to third base i guess and then we um got likepast third base, but not to home plate.  i really like her.

NEW WAY- first, there was a triple, then we got and inside thepark home run, and started thinking, it's hall of fame time.

NEW WAY- So there i was with the bases loaded and nobody out,

when i balked during the seventh inning stretch and i had to call ina relief pitcher.

Well, there you have it, i hope it has cleared up a lot ofthe confusion and helps you out.

I hope that you enjoy this little tarticle on America's favorite pastime!

.. since I'm now past fifty, the "encores" are getting tuffer and   tuffer.

A fellow was reading the paper one day lamenting the fact that his doctor has ordered him to lose 75 pounds.  Next thing he sees is an advertisement for a guaranteed weight loss program.  Guaranteed like heck, he thinks to himself. But lets see what they think they can do. He calls them on the phone and subscribes to the 3 day, 10 LB weight loss program. The next day there comes a knock at his door, and when he answers, there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic 19 year old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of Nikes and a sign hanging around her neck.  She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company.  The sign reads, If you can catch me, you can have me. Well, without a second thought he takes off after her (like who wouldn't). A few miles later, huffing and puffing, he finally catches her and has his way with her.  After they are through he kisses the girl one last time and thinks to himself with a nod, I like the way this company does business. For the next two days, the same girl shows up and the same thing happens each time.  On the fourth day, he weighs himself and, sure enough, he has lost 10 pounds.  Deciding that he likes his somewhat more slender physique, not to mention the method of treatment, he calls the company back  and subscribes to their 5 day, 20 LB weight loss program. He thinks that losing 20 pounds in only 5 days seems like a lot, but he is intrigued by what their workout schedule might be like this time. As expected, the next day there comes a knock at his door. When he answers it there stands a 22 year old knockout dressed in nothing but a pair of Reeboks and a sign hanging around her neck. She is simply stunning, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.  She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, If you can catch me, you can have me. He's out the door like a shot. This gal is in excellent shape and it takes a while to catch her.  But when he does, it is worth every cramp and wheeze.  She is wonderful, the best he has ever had. He is really looking forward to the next four days.

.. For the next four days, the same girl shows up and the same thing happens each time, much to his delight.  On the sixth day, he weighs himself and, unbelievably, he has lost another 20 pounds.  I love this company, he thinks to himself, I never knew losing weight could be so easy and so much fun. Feeling much better about himself, he decides to go for broke and subscribe to the companies 7 day, 50 pound weight loss program. Are you sure, sir? asks the representative on the phone. This is our most rigorous program. Absolutely, says he, I love your program. haven't felt  this good in years!  The next day there comes a knock at his door and he enthusiastically answers it. There stands before him a 200 pound perfect specimen of a man dressed in nothing but racing spikes and a sign around his neck.  He introduces himself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, If I can catch you, I can have you.

As she sat on the bus, on her way home, she felt that she had to share the good news with someone.  The gentleman sitting next to her seemed as good as anyone to share the good news with. Sir, she said, I just received the best news you could ever imagine.  I have to share it with someone or I'll bust.  She told him the news that the doctor had told her about being pregnant.

The man shared her enthusiam as he shared his expierence.  He said he was a farmer and he had trouble with his hens laying eggs.  He stated that he went out to the hen house one morning and all of his hens had layed eggs. He was so happy. he added, "but confidentially, I changed cocks."The newly pregnant woman responded, "Confidentially, me too."

It was laying limp in my hand. It was very long, kind of thin.  I slid it between my fingers until I got to the end of it. I was turning it on.  It became firm in my hands, and the end was wet.  Then it got very hard and began gushing out of the tip.

Then I took the garden hose and watered the bushes.

they inflate and float you up to heaven."Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation and goes offquite satisfied.

Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes intothe kitchen."Mummy, mummy, Aunt Mary is dying!"What do you mean? says his mother.

A tall woman met a midget at a party. The midget was barely three feet tall but they were attracted to each other.

After a few drinks they went back to the tall woman's apartment."I can't imagine what it will be like making love to a midget," said the woman, "especially with the size difference and all."

"Just take off your cloths, lie back on the bed, spread your legs apart and close your eyes," said the midget.

The woman did as she was told and soon she felt the biggest thing she'd ever experienced inside her.

Within a few minutes the woman had climaxed eight times."If you think that was good," said the midget with a smirk, "Just wait till I get BOTH legs in there!"

What Not to Name Your DogEverybody has a dog called Rover or Spot. I call my dog "Sex". When I went to city hall to buy a licence I told the clerk I wanted a licence for Sex. He said "I'd like one too." But then I said "This is a dog." He said he didn't care what she looked like. Then I said "You don't understand I've had Sex since I was nine years old." He said "You must have been quite a kid." When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me. I told the motel clerk that I wanted a room for my wife, me and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the place was for sex. I said "You don't understand Sex keeps me awake at night." The clerk said "Me too." One day I entered Sex in a contest, but before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just standing there looking around. I told him I had planned to have Sex in the contest. He told me that I should have sold my own tickets. "But you don't understand," I said. I hoped to have Sex on T.

V. He called me a show off.

When my wife and I seperated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said "Your honor, I had Sex before I was married." The judge said "Me too." Then I told him that after I was married Sex left. He said "Me too."Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking around town for him. A cop came over to me and asked "What are you doing in this alley at 4 o'clock in the morning?" I said I'm looking for Sex. My case comes up Friday.

Playgirl Rejection LetterNovember 30, 1995PLAYGIRL, INC.

Dear Mrs. Smith,        We wish to thank you for your letter and the polaroid pictureof your husband.  We agree that his appearance in our March issue asthe Playgirl's "Man of the Month" centerfold would have been a truly fitting way for you to honor your 75th anniversary of wedded bliss,

and as a life-time memento on his birthday.        We submitted the picture to our various panels of judges, asit is our routine procedure, with the following results:        When rated by our panel of average American women (ages 25 to40) on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), his body was rateda -2.        To further justify our ratings, we submitted your photographto another panel of women in the age bracket of 45 to 100.  We couldn'tget them to stop laughing long enough to take the time to rate him.        The old American women panel, aged 70 to 100, widowed for over twenty years, said "We'll retain our widowed status!"        The Organization of Nude Portrait Painters (thinking perhapsthey could touch up the picture), said "We can't perform miracles!"        We therefore regret that we will not be able to satisfy your request for John on his 75th wedding anniversary.  We do, however, invite you to submit other pictures for Playgirl's centerfold.  Pleasebe advised that the minimum requirement is that the staple used to hold the centerfold in place in the magazine cannot completely obliterate what we refer to as "the item of interest" as it would in John's case.

Yours truly,

Jane BrownPlaygirl, Inc.

There was a young man in the Air Force who was so well- endowed that it was bothering his knee. Three Air Force doctors and one Air Force nurse were in the operating room to remedy the situation. The first doctor said, "We'll just take a big hunk off the end." They discussed it and decided that would affect his sensitivity.

The second doctor said, "We'll just take a big hunk out of the middle of it." They discussed this, and decided it would change the texture and feel of it.

The third doctor said, "We'll just take a big hunk off the base of it." They discussed this, too, and agreed that it might give him erection problems.

The doctors heard a sniffling, and looked over at the nurse who had tears running down her cheeks. The nurse cried, "Can't we just make his legs longer?"

A Guide to Love and Sex for VirginsAs a young, modern virgin of the nineties, you no doubt have manyquestions concerning romance, love, even s.

.e.

.x. In this sensitive andfrank "question and answer" format, noted sex therapist Dr Ruth explainseverything you've ever wondered about.

Q: Where can I find the man of my dreams ?

A: This is a difficult question, since every virgin probably has adifferent ideal of what their own personal Prince Charming should actand look like. However, when it comes to finding Mr Right, I can giveyou a good suggestion on where to start - and that's in a bar. That'sright, go to a bar.

.. preferably the kind that smells of stale beer andlots of men crowded around watching a sports event on television. Pick aman that looks interesting - it's best to stay away from the shallow"pretty boys" in designer clothes with bulging muscles. Instead, Irecommend you pick somebody a little older and wiser, possiblyreassuring pot belly. Boldly approach him, offer to buy him a few beers,

then invite him back to your place. He'll advise you from there.

Q: How do I know if I found Mr Right ?

A: Unfortunately, there's no sure way to tell. Therefore, I suggest youtry out many different kinds of men and many different kinds of bars.

Q: Do men like aggresive virgins?

A: Definitely. Although they don't admit it, men are often shy - so it'sup to you to be bold. In addition to bars, don't be afraid to approachmen on streetcorners, in restaurants, even in restrooms. Break the icewith simple "hello", followed by an offer to buy them dinner, drinks -even an expensive gift. Then invite them to back to your place.

Q: What if a man's married ?

A: Go for it. This is a great opportunity to enjoy the valuableexperience a married man possesses, without being tied down by any sortof commitment.

Q: But what if I fall in love with a married man ?

A: This is a tough one, especially if you're a woman and find yourselfpregnant. Ask him how he feels about his wife and family. If he says hiswife doesn't understand him and he's thinking of leaving her, believehim and continue your relationship, secure in the knowledge that he'llsoon make good his promise. Married men rarely lie about such importantmatters.

Q: How do I know if I'm ready for sex ?

A: Ask your boyfriend. He'll know when the time is right. When it comesto love and sex, experienced men are much more responsible, sincethey're not confused emotionally as virgins. It's a proven fact.

Q: Should I have sex on the first date ?

A: YES. Before if possible.

Q: What exactly happens during the act of sex ?

A: Again, this is entirely up to the man. The important thing toremember is that you must do whatever he tells you without question.

Sometimes, however, he may ask you to do certain things that may atfirst seem strange to you. Do them anyway.

Q: How long should the sex act last ?

A: This is a natural and normal part of nature, so don't feel ashamed orembarrassed. After your man has finished making love, he'll have anatural desire to leave you suddenly, and go out with his friends toplay golf. Or perhaps another activity, such as going out with hisfriends to the bar for the purpose of consuming large amounts of alcoholand sharing a few personal thoughts with his buddies. Don't feel leftout - while he's gone you can busy yourself by doing his laundry,

cleaning his apartment, or perhaps even going out to buy him anexpensive gift. He'll come back when he's ready.

Q: What is "afterplay" ?

A: After a man has finished making love, he needs to replenish his manlyenergy. "Afterplay" is simply a list of important activities for you todo after the lovemaking. This includes lighting his cigarette, makinghim a sandwich or pizza, bringing him a few beers, or leaving him aloneto sleep while you go out and buy him an expensive gift.

Q: Does the size of the penis matter ?

A: Yes. Although many virgins believe that quality, not quantity, isimportant, studies show this is simply not true. The average erect malepenis measures about six centimeters. Anything longer than that isextremely rare and, if by some chance your lover's sexual organ is sevencentimeters or over, you should go down on your knees and thank youlucky stars and do everything possible to please him, such as doing hislaundry, cleaning his apartment and buying him an expensive gift.

Q: What about the orgasm ?

A: What about it ? There's no such thing. It's a myth.

Q: Are you sure ?

A: Will you stop asking so many questions ? Do you distrust experiencedmen or something? Instead, prove how much you care for your boyfriend bygoing out and buying him an expensive gift.

A man goes to the doctor with a long history of migraine headaches.

When the doctor does his history and physical, he discovers that hispoor patient has had practically every therapy known to man for hismigraines and STILL no improvement."Listen," says the Doctor, "I have migraines, too and the advice I'mgoing to give you isn't really anything I learned in medical school,

but it's advice that I've gotten from my own experience. When I havea migraine, I go home, get in a nice hot bathtub, and soak for awhile. Then I have my wife sponge me off with the hottest water I canstand, especially around the forehead. This helps a little. Then Iget out of the tub, take her into the bedroom, and even if my head iskilling me, I force myself to have sex with her. Almost always, theheadache is immediately gone. Now, give it a try, and come back andsee me in six weeks."Six weeks later, the patient returns with a big grin. "Doc! I tookyour advice and it works! It REALLY WORKS! I've had migraines for17 years and this is the FIRST time anyone has ever helped me!"

"Well," says the physician, "I'm glad I could help."

"By the way, Doc," the patient adds, "you have a REALLY nice house."

A little boy and his grandfather are raking leaves in the yard.  The little  boy finds an earthworm trying to get back into its hole. He says, "Grandpa, I  bet I can put that worm back in that hole." The grandfather replies, "I'll bet you five dollars you can't.  It's too wiggly and limp to put back in that little hole." The little boy runs into the house and comes back out with a can of hair spray. He sprays the worm until it is straight and stiff as a board.  Then he puts the worm back into the hole. The grandfather hands the little boy five dollars, grabs the hair spray, and  runs into the house. Thirty minutes later the grandfather comes back out and  hands the little boy another five dollars. The little boy says, "Grandpa, you already gave me five dollars." The grandfather replies, "I know. That's from your grandma."+------------------------------------------------------------------------ On their first night together, the newly weds decided to set up signals concerning their "urges".

Biology Class   In a biology class, the professor was discussing the high glucose   levels found in semen. A young female (FRESHMAN) raised her hand and   asked, "If I understand, you're saying there is a lot of glucose, as   in sugar   in male semen?"   "That's correct", responded the professor, going on to add statistical   info.   Raising her hand again, the girl asked, "Then why doesn't it taste   sweet?"   After a stunned silence, the whole class burst out laughing, the poor   girl's face turned bright red, and as she realized exactly what she   had inadvertently said (or rather implied), she picked up her books   without a word and walked out of class.

000.

00, they concluded   that the reason the   head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure   during sex.   After the study was published, the University of South Carolina   decided to do their own   study. After $250,

000.

00, and 3 years of research, they concluded that   the reason was to   give the woman more pleasure during sex.   The University of Georgia, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted   their own study.   After 2 weeks and a cost of around $75.

Golf in the Bedroom   Rules of Play   Each player shall provide his own equipment - normally one club and   two balls.   Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.   Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and   keep the balls out of the   hole.   For the most effective play, the club owner should have a firm shaft.   Course owners are   permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.   Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid   damage to the hole.   The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until   the course owner is   satisfied that the play is complete. Failure to do so may result in   denied permission to play   the course again.   It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon   arrival at the course.   The experienced players will normally take time to admire the entire   course, with special   attention to well formed bunkers.   Players are encouraged not to mention other courses they have played,   or are currently   playing, to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners have   been known to   damage a player's equipment for this reason.   Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own   protection.   Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly   scheduled, particularly   when a new course is being played for the first time. Previous players   have been known to   become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they   considered to be a private   course.   Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.   Some players may be   embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair.   Players are advised to be   extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find   alternate means of play   at this time.   Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before   attempting to play the   back nine.   Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared to   proceed at a quicker   pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.   It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the   same course several   times in one month.

This man was having problems getting it up to have sex with his wife,   so he went to the   doctor for advice. The doctor told him the next time he wanted to have   sex, to stick his   finger in his wife's pussy, and then rub it under his nose, and the   smell would cause his   hormones to kick in, and he would obtain an erection. That night, he   decided to make his   move. He turned out all the lights and got into bed. He put his finger   in her pussy, and then   rubbed it under his nose. He felt a tingling in his cock, and it began   to stiffen. Amazed, he   decided to see what would happen if he used two fingers. He stuck them   in her pussy, then   rubbed them both under his nose, and his cock quickly jumped to 3/4   erect. He decided to   try 3 fingers, so he put them in her pussy, then rubbed them all   around under his nose.   Soon he was sporting the biggest hard on he could remember. He said,   "Honey, quick   turn on the lights, and check this out!" She turned on the lights, and   with his dick standing   tall, he proudly asked, "What do you think?" She looked at him and   said, "Looks like the   worst nose bleed I've ever seen!"

One evening after attending a concert, two men were walking down the   road when they   saw a well-dressed and attractive looking woman walking ahead of them.   One of the men   turned to the other and said, "I'd give 50 bucks to spend the night   with her." To their   surprise the woman overheard the remark. Turning round she said, "I'll   take you up on   that." She had good appearance and a nice body, so after bidding his   companion 'good   night', he followed her back to her apartment and they went straight   to bed. The following   morning the man presented her with 25.

00. She demanded the rest of her   money."If you   don't give me the remaining $25 I'll sue you for it." He laughed,   saying, "I'd like to see   you get it on those grounds!" The next day,

he was surprised to receive   a summons   ordering his appearance in Court as Defendant in a lawsuit. He rushed   to his atorney and   explained the circumstances to him. His atorney said, "She can't   possibly get a judgment   against you on such grounds, but it would interesting to see how her   case will be   presented." After the usual preliminaries, her lawyer addressed the   court as follows:-   Your honor, my client this lady here is the owner of a fine piece of   property, a garden spot   surrounded by a profuse of luscious shrubbery, which she agreed to   rent to the Defendant   for a specified length of time, for an agreed upon sum of $50. The   Defendant took   possession of the property, used it extensively for the purpose for   which it was rented, but   upon evacuation of the premises he paid only $25; half the agreed   amount. The rent was by   no means excessive, even though it was restricted property, and we ask   Judgment be   granted against Defendant to ensure payment of the balance.

The   Defendant's lawyer was   impressed and amused at the way his opponent had presented the case.   His defense was,   therefore, somewhat altered from the way he had originally planned to   present it.   Your Honor, my client agrees the young lady has a fine piece of   property,

that he did rent   such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from   the transaction.   However, my client found a well on the property around which he placed   his stones,   erected a pump, and sunk a shaft, all labor being performed by him   personally. We claim   these improvements to the property were sufficient to offset the   unpaid amount and that the   plaintiff was more than adequately satisfied and compensated for the   rental of the said   property. We therefore ask Judgment not be granted.   The young lady's lawyer's comeback was this:- Your Honor, my client   agrees that the   Defendant did find a well on her property and that he did make   improvements such as my   opponent has described. However had the Defendant not known the well   existed, he would   not have rented the property. Also, upon evacuating the premises, the   Defendant removed   his stones, pulled out his shaft and took the pump with him. In so   doing, he not only   dragged his equipment through the shrubbery, leaving my client to do   the cleaning up, but   he left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, thus   making it very easily   accessible to little children. We therefore ask that Judgment be   granted.   SHE GOT IT!

Great A Hot & Juicy Story   Well, I was loafin' around the salad bar at the burger stand one chili   day on Coney Island, when I Frito-Lay'd my eyes on the sweetest little   tomato I'd ever seen. Let's just say I could tell she wasn't gonna be   ice-cold or taste like some of those cheaper spreads I'd eaten.   So I mustard up my courage and I whispered, "Hey, Mama Bird! You got a   sweet set of sesame-seed buns, and I'd live to bury my open-face in   your McMuffin snack pack. And maybe later I could drive-in my Jumbo   Jack in your Box. So, what's your name, anyway?"   "Wendy," she replied, and said that her buns were always hot and   fresh. Well, it seemed like an invitation to me, so I unzipped my   French-fly, pulled down my hash-browns and whipped out my   Quarter-Pounder.   She took one look at my foot-long Weinerschnitzel and said, "Holy   enchirito, what a Whopper! I haven't seen a sausage and a pair of   McNuggets like that since I was in the sack with Long John Silver over   at the Colonel's place, and I probably won't see another 'til Foster   freezes over. And believe me, I relish the thought of squeezin' the   mayonnaise right outta that big Sloppy Joe of yours."   I said, "Look, honey.

..

those meatheads are just horseradish. I'm the   supreme Burger King around here. And by the way, aren't you hungry?"   "Yeah," she shot back, "I haven't even had my breakfast, Jack." It   wasn't long before she was munching on my Big Mac and eventually took   down the whole enchilada. I could tell I wouldn't be able to hold the   pickles or hold the lettuce much longer, so I just blew a whole gallon   of my lo-cal secret sauce to go. She took a big gulp and giggled,   "Oooh, that's fast food. A bit salty, but quality you can taste.

..

and   finger lickin' good, too!"   She said, "So what's yer name, hot dog? Orange you Julius?"   "No," I replied, but you can call me Pizza Man, 'cause I deliver!"   Well anyway, I turned her around, tore off her wrapper, and wedged my   Big Boy between her patties and right up into her hot cherry bendover.   She screamed, "I FOUND THE BEEF, I FOUND THE BEEF!" which just gave me   the urge to keep pounding my SuperBurrito in and out.

..

in and   out.

..

and in and out.

and in and out of her hot little micro.   Well, we were still playing Pup 'n' Taco , when she confessed her real   name wasn't Wendy.

A young married couple has difficulties conceiving a baby, so after a while the wife consults her doctor, who recommends the minor of three possible operations. The operation is performed, but a month later, she's still not pregnant, so she goes to see the doctor again. This time he recommends the medium operation, a somewhat more serious operation, but still not as complicated as the third alternative. But, there's still no result, and another month later she's back in the doctors office, and this time she gets the big one. After having recovered in some weeks, the couple resumes normal marital activities, and this time they actually succeed in conceiving a baby.

Filled with joy, the young wife now sees the doctor for the regular examination during pregnancy and says, "We're so happy doctor, we're finally having a baby. But what was this third operation actually all about? The first two weren't that bad, but this last one I think must have been quite a job, I was dizzy for weeks after."

"Well," the doctor replies, "since the first two standard operations failed, we started suspecting your method rather than your ability, so I made a connection from your throat to your uterus."

A man wonders if having sex on the Sabbath is a sin because he is not sure if sex is work or play. So he goes to a priest and asks for his opinion on this question.

After consulting the Bible, the priest says, " My son, after an exhaustive search, I am positive that sex is work and is therefore not permitted on Sundays."The man thinks: " What does a priest know about sex?" So he goes to a minister, who after all is a married man and experienced in this matter. He queries the minister and receives the same reply. Sex is work and therefore not for the Sabbath!

Not pleased with the reply, he seeks out the ultimate authority: a man of thousands of years tradition and knowledge. In other words, he goes to a rabbi. The Rabbi ponders the question, then states, " My son, sex is definitely play."The man replies, "Rabbi, how can you be so sure when so many others tell me sex is work?"The Rabbi softly speaks, "If sex were work, my wife would have the maid do it."

This woman has her bridge club every Thursday night and after a peaceful game or two with the ladies, she goes home to fix her husband dinner when he gets home from work. Well, one Thursday, she's playing a great game and she has an incredible hand when she notices the time. "Oh, no! I have to go fix my husband his dinner! He's going to be so angry if it's not ready on time." And she dashes out of her friend's house, her great hand forgotten on the table.

When she gets home, she realizes she has very little time, not enough time to go to the supermarket, and all she has in the cupboard is a wilted lettuce leaf, an egg, and a can of cat food. In a panic, she opens the can of cat food, stirs in the egg, and garnishes it with the lettuce leaf just as her husband is pulling up. She watches in horror as he sits down to his dinner, and then she realizes he is loving it! "Mmmm, darling, this is the best dinner you have made for me in forty years of marriage. You can make this for me any old day, mmmmm!" And that night they had sex for the first time in months and it was great!

Needless to say, every Thursday from then on, she made this dinner for her husband. She tells her bridge cronies about it and they are all horrified."You're going to kill him," they say, or "He's just yanking your chain," but she continued to make him his cat food dinner and then, afterwards, they would bonk like fiends.

Two months later, her husband died and all the bridge women the Thursday after the funeral attacked our new widow for being so callous. "You killed him! We told you that feeding him that cat food every week would do him in! How can you just sit there so calmly and play bridge knowing you murdered your husband?"The wife stoically replied, "I didn't kill him. He fell off the mantel when he was licking his ass."

Little Johnny was 7 years old, and like other boys his age,

rather curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about courting fromother boys and he wondered what it was and how it was done.

One day he took his questions to his mother, and she becameflustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny she told him tohide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sisterand her boyfriend. This he did, and the following morning Johnnydescribed everything to his mother.

Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned offmost of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figuredsis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. Hemust have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse tofeel her heart, just like the doctor would. Except he's not as goodas the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.

He was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them startedpanting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have beengetting cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sisgot toward the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. Iknow it was a fever because sis told him she was really hot.

Finally, I found out what was making them so sick.

..

a big eel hadgotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pantsand stood there about 9 inches long. Honest! anyway, he grabbed itin one hand to keep it from getting away. When sis saw it she gotreally scared. Her eyes big and her mouth fell open, and she startedcalling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about theones I saw at the lake!

Anyway, sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by bitting its head off.

All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go. I guess it bit herback. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he tooka muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep itfrom biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get ascissor lock on it, and he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eelput up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squeeling and herboyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel bysquishing it between them.

After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriendsat up and sure enough they had killed the eel. I knew it was dead becauseit just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis andher boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went on courtinganyway. He started hugging and kissing her again, and by golly, the eel wasn'tdead after all. It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eelsare like cats.

.. They have nine lives or something.

This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After about35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. I know it was dead this timebecause I saw sis's boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet.

Mother fainted.
